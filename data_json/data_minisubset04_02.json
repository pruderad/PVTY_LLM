Besides landscapes and abstract and figurative composition, there is a recurring ocean theme in his works, inspired by his longtime occupation as a captain of sailing ships.\n\n Career \nFrom 1966-68 Raku\u0161an spent two years studying figurative drawing and painting in the studio of Professor Frantisek Nedved. He also studied expressive painting, with materials including charcoal, ink and pastel.

He has a combined range of 3 octaves but has spanned an additional octave while performing \"Opera\", a rearranged instrumental by Vitas, a song he stated he cannot practice (including perform) more than 4 times a day.  He later became the first Taiwanese artist to record his album in One Take and One Take Live with no further editing.\n\n Life and career \nLin was born in Keelung, Taiwan, and is the oldest of 3 children.  In 1991, as a university student, he formed the duo Ukulele with Lee Chi and gained attention in Taiwan and Hong Kong with their debut album \"Confession\" (\u8a8d\u932f).  The band made 4 Mandarin albums, 2 English cover albums, and a compilation album before disbanding in 1996.  He was working at a power plant in a mine, but his colleague were all killed in a landslide, so he moved on to work in his father's family publishing company, for which he is still the equivalent of COO.  In 1999, he was forced to leave the music industry to care for his mother.

As of 2010, he taught classes in precision journalism, reporting public affairs, news writing, multimedia journalism, introduction to newsroom statistics, and media research methods.\n\nDoig was a pioneer in the use of computer-assisted data analysis by reporters. For example, he was Miami Herald research editor when Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida in 1992. Analysis of property damages and local government building records showed that newer structures were more likely to have been damaged by the storm, and the team argued that easing the zoning, inspection, and building codes had caused greater storm losses, largely in a 16-page article \"What Went Wrong\". The newspaper won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service citing its coverage \"that not only helped readers cope\u00a0... but also showed how lax zoning, inspection and building codes had contributed to the destruction.\"\"Public Service\".

Hinoue's choice of her pseudonym stems from the manga C by Sh\u014d Kitagawa; the protagonist in the manga was named . Before forming Key, Hinoue worked for the company Tactics where she had a hand in the creation of the company's three games: D\u014dsei, Moon, and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. After forming Key, Hinoue has become known for her work on such titles as Kanon, Air and Clannad. Her d\u014djinshi circle is known as \"Soldier Frog\". In September 2016, Hinoue resigned from Key and VisualArt's.\n\nCareer\nHinoue entered a vocational school to become a professional artist due to the influence of the popular adult visual novel D\u014dky\u016bsei by ELF. Her first work for a visual novel was as one of many artists for Tamago Ry\u014dri by Bon Bin Pompon in 1996, but shortly after transferred to the software company Tactics under the publisher Nexton. There, she was the art director of three games: D\u014dsei, Moon, and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. After the completion of One, Hinoue and much of the staff who made both Moon and One, including Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito, Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS, left Tactics to work under the video game publishing company VisualArt's where they formed the company Key. At Key, Hinoue was the sole art director for their first three titles, Kanon, Air, and Clannad, but did not contribute for the two games that followed, Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet, and Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life.\n\nCategory:Japanese illustrators\nCategory:Japanese video game designers\nCategory:Key (company)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Japanese video game artists\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:Women video game designers",

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hix was based in London, but announced in January 2021 that he would be relocating to Dorset permanently after five of his restaurants were put into administration.\n\nEarly life\nHix was born and raised in West Bay, Dorset. His parents divorced when he was six; while his brother Kevin went to live with their mother, their father had custody of Mark. His father was absent much of the time, so he spent a lot of time with his paternal grandfather, who was a jack of all trades: a chrysanthemum gardener, Bridport mayor, and bar owner.

Her parents are Glendene Grant and Dwight Foster. Jessie Foster had spent some time living in Calgary, Alberta. In 2005, Foster and a friend of hers visited Florida together, and then stopped by Las Vegas on the way back in May where Foster decided to stay. Before disappearing the following year, Foster became involved in prostitution, was arrested once for solicitation, and was the victim of battery on several occasions.\n\nInvestigation\nFoster was one of four sex workers who disappeared in Las Vegas between 2003 and 2006. The bodies of the other three have been found. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department launched an investigation of a person in question, bringing in a forensic scientist to spray luminol onto surfaces at crime scenes to detect invisible blood stains; but found nothing at his property, nor has he been interrogated on her disappearance. Benjamin Perrin of Vancouver, British Columbia, received a George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature nomination for having written Invisible Chains, a book that prominently deals with human trafficking, and includes the disappearance of Jessie Foster. The documentary Trafficked No More, features her story and led to some tips to her whereabouts.\n\nCategory:1984 births\nCategory:Canada\u2013United States relations\nCategory:2000s missing person cases\nCategory:2006 in Nevada\nCategory:20th-century Canadian people\nCategory:20th-century Canadian women\nCategory:21st-century Canadian people\nCategory:21st-century Canadian women\nCategory:Canadian expatriates in the United States\nCategory:Canadian female prostitutes\nCategory:Crimes against sex workers in the United States\nCategory:Human trafficking in the United States\nCategory:Missing person cases in Nevada\nCategory:Events in Las Vegas\nCategory:Prostitution in Nevada\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:History of women in Nevada\nCategory:Violence against women in Nevada\nCategory:Women in Las Vegas",

His work over a 40-year career at Bell Labs earned him the Marconi Prize, the IEEE Medal of Honor, the National Medal of Technology and many other awards.\n\nIn a series of papers in the early 1960s, he developed the theory of stable optical resonators, which has been fundamental to laser developments ever since. He then turned to the applications of holograms to optical systems, developing with some of his colleagues the basic theory of thick holograms that led to the development of a whole range of optical components, including filters and couplers to integrated optical devices. His innovation was the beginning of the \"distributed feedback laser.\" He also contributed the development of wavelength-division multiplexing.\n\nCategory:1932 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Alumni of the University of Oxford\nCategory:Austrian electrical engineers\nCategory:Laser researchers\nCategory:IEEE Medal of Honor recipients\nCategory:Scientists at Bell Labs\nCategory:Fellows of the IEEE\nCategory:National Medal of Technology recipients\nCategory:Presidents of Optica (society)\nCategory:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nCategory:Alumni of St Peter's College, Oxford\nCategory:Honorary Fellows of St Peter's College, Oxford\nCategory:Optical engineers",

He worked with GT and then his own Love Bunch sound system and then recorded for King Tubby's Firehouse label, now singing in a similar style to Tenor Saw. The early King Kong recordings for Tubby were over early digital rhythms, and included songs such as \"AIDS\" and \"Babylon\", and established him as a popular artist. His first album release was split with another of Tubby's singers, Anthony Red Rose, with Two Big Bull Inna One Pen issued on Firehouse. During 1986 and 1987, Kong recorded for several of Jamaica's top producers, including Prince Jammy, with whom he enjoyed his biggest hits with \"Trouble Again\" (the title track from his Jammy-produced debut album proper) and \"Legal We Legal\",Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd ed., Rough Guides, , p. 300 Black Scorpio, Harry J, Errol Thompson, Ossie Hibbert, Bunny Lee, and Prince Jazzbo. While many of his songs were typical in content of the era, several of his songs had political and cultural themes.Foster, Chuck (1999) Roots Rock Reggae: an Oral History of Reggae Music from Ska to Dancehall, Billboard Books, , p. 158 He released several albums during this period before relocating first to New York, and then to Canada in the late 1980s, where he released material occasionally on his Conscious Music label. The death of Tenor Saw in 1988 prompted King Kong to release \"He Was a Friend\" as a tribute, and in 1989 he relocated to England and recorded with Mafia & Fluxy and Gussie P in the early 1990s. He began recording more regularly again in the 2000s.\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Musicians from Kingston, Jamaica\nCategory:Jamaican reggae singers\nCategory:1962 births\nCategory:Greensleeves Records artists\nCategory:Firehouse 12 Records artists",
