Influenced by his teacher Joseph Beuys, Hack develops the social sculpture (\"Soziale Plastik\") of Beuys with a global aspect and is the first to import it into the cyberspace dimension. Hack's large paintings on tarpaulin and works on paper deal with the challenges of global change and their cultural, social dimensions. Hack was one of the first media artists using the Internet, one of the most famous projects is the virtual roof, where everybody could get a piece of the sky above a German city. Public interventions with the World Climate Refugee Camp, a model camp made of 1.000 miniature tents, since 2007 to visualize the plight of millions of climate refugees in the center of European cities.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1956 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People from Bad Honnef\nCategory:German artists\nCategory:Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\nCategory:Students of Joseph Beuys",

        "text": "Eugene K. Palmer (born April 4, 1939) is an American fugitive wanted for allegedly killing his daughter-in-law, Tammy Palmer (n\u00e9e Pannirello), in Stony Point, New York, on September 24, 2012. On May 29, 2019, he was named by the FBI as the 523rd fugitive to be placed on its Ten Most Wanted list. On July 20, 2022, he was removed from the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives List. Despite his removal from the Top Ten List, he remains a highly wanted fugitive, and has an international Interpol warrant issued against him.\n\nBackground\nEugene Palmer's son, John Palmer, was married to Tammy Palmer (n\u00e9e Pannirello), and the couple lived together with their two children at a property owned by Eugene in Stony Point, New York. Eugene lived next door to the couple. The relationship between John and Tammy began to deteriorate and they eventually started seeing other people. Tammy filed for a restraining order against John which enraged Eugene. Tammy also threatened to file for divorce and sue for the land belonging to Eugene. Authorities say this started a feud between Eugene and Tammy that would culminate in a heated confrontation several days before the murder of Tammy.\n\nCategory:1939 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:2012 murders in the United States\nCategory:21st-century American criminals\nCategory:American male criminals\nCategory:American murderers\nCategory:Criminals from New York (state)\nCategory:FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\nCategory:Fugitives wanted by the United States\nCategory:Fugitives wanted on murder charges\nCategory:Male murderers\nCategory:People from Stony Point, New York",

He is best known for the single \"Bag\" from his second album, Keep it Clean, which was featured on Madden 19, although he received a considerable amount of publicity for his single, \"Black\", which was featured on his first album Quebec Place. He has been compared to Vince Staples and Ghostface Killah.  James is currently signed to Rostrum Record. He has performed alongside Bas on the Milky Way tour throughout North America and EarthGang throughout Europe. He has also had the song \"Black\" appear on the U.S. television series Dear White People. James has worked with a variety of notable artists over his career, including Pusha T, Mac Ayres, Kallitechnis, Cool Company, and Landon Sears.\n\n Personal life \nInnanet James was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, but split his time growing up between Montgomery and Prince George's counties, Maryland and Washington, DC, respectively. James has stated that Lil Wayne's mixtape Da Drought 3, particularly the \"Upgrade U\" freestyle was the most influential record in molding his career as a rapper. He draws inspiration from the Wu Tang Clan, 50 Cent, Amy Winehouse, and Smokey Robinson, but typically writes what is in his environment. He has stated that he has been composing rap since he was in the third grade. Before finding success within the rap industry, James worked at a DSW and took graphic design classes. He is very vocal of his distaste for acting US President, Donald Trump and has expressed interest in the political campaigns of Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders.\n\nCategory:1995 births\nCategory:Rappers from Silver Spring, Maryland\nCategory:Living people",

She is a former foreign correspondent and former chief correspondent and principal substitute anchor of PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. She has written two books, including a novella, Last Light, which was published by Flint Hills Publishing (March, 2024), and a memoir. Her 2008 documentary, The Judge and the General, (co-directed with Patricio Lanfranco), aired on television around the world, winning many awards. She has reported from Cambodia, Vietnam, Chile, Haiti, Iraq, and Iran, among other places. Having previously lived in Peru, Chile, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. for extended periods, she now lives in Berkeley, California.\n\nEarly life and education\nFarnsworth was born Elizabeth Fink  in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of Jane (Mills) Fink (1911- 1953) and H. Bernerd Fink (1909\u20131999), while her father was stationed at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Naval Air Station during WW II (now known as Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport).  From this union, she had one older sister, Marcia (Fink) Anderson (1937\u20132022).  Shortly after Elizabeth's birth, the family moved (1944) back to Topeka, Kansas, where both her parents had been born and raised. Both of her parents are descended from easterners who came to Kansas as pioneers. Farnsworth's mother's great-grandparents were abolitionists. In 1953, when she was 9 years old, her mother died of cancer. Her father remarried in 1955 to a widow, Ruth (Garvey) Cochener, who had three children from her previous marriage.\n\nCategory:1943 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Middlebury College alumni\nCategory:American television personalities\nCategory:American women television personalities\nCategory:Stanford University alumni\nCategory:People from Topeka, Kansas\nCategory:Writers from Minneapolis\nCategory:Topeka High School alumni",

In Iceland he has pioneered the use of population-scale genetics to understand variation in the sequence of the human genome. His work has focused on how genomic diversity is generated and on the discovery of sequence variants impacting susceptibility to common diseases. This population approach has served as a model for national genome projects around the world and contributed to the realization of several aspects of precision medicine.\n\n Biography \nKari Stefansson was born in 1949 in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. He was the second youngest of the five children of S\u00f3lveig Halld\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir and Stef\u00e1n J\u00f3nsson, a radio personality, writer and democratic socialist member of parliament.Obituary notice for Stef\u00e1n J\u00f3nsson, Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 18 September 1990, accessed at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1729310 He completed his secondary education at Reykjavik Junior College and received his M.D. in 1976 and his Dr. med. in 1986 from the University of Iceland.

Meissner completed an engineering degree at the Ecole Centrale de Lille in 1995. Meissner moved to the Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris VI, France where she investigated the predictability of the West African monsoon based on ocean-atmosphere fluxes off the coast of Senegal. Meissner received her Ph.D. at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research at the Universit\u00e4t Bremen, Germany in 1999. She developed an atmosphere model and a sea ice model and coupled both to an existing ocean model to study the long-term variability of the thermohaline circulation. For this work she received the Annette Barthelt Prize for outstanding research in the field of marine science in 2000.http://www.annette-barthelt-stiftung.de,+http://www.annette-barthelt-stiftung.de/snippetmaster/edit/preistraeger.htm \n\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Australian oceanographers\nCategory:Academic staff of the University of Victoria\nCategory:Academic staff of the University of New South Wales\nCategory:Pierre and Marie Curie University alumni\nCategory:\u00c9cole centrale de Lille alumni\nCategory:University of Bremen alumni\nCategory:German oceanographers\nCategory:Women oceanographers",

After graduating, she opened an art gallery, worked as a waitress at a pizzeria, and had a brief stint working as a stripper and an escort.

In 1997 after the band broke up, Juanes continued solo and in 2000 he released the album, F\u00edjate Bien, which earned him three Latin Grammys. His follow-up album, Un D\u00eda Normal, was released in 2002 and was later certified platinum throughout America. Juanes' third album, Mi Sangre (2004), became an international bestseller, managing to position well in a number of countries around the world. It achieved success due to the single \"La Camisa Negra\".\n\n \nCategory:1972 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Chevaliers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\nCategory:Colombian emigrants to the United States\nCategory:Colombian people of Basque descent\nCategory:Colombian people of Spanish descent\nCategory:Colombian pop singers\nCategory:Colombian rock guitarists\nCategory:Colombian rock singers\nCategory:Colombian singer-songwriters\nCategory:Colombian male singer-songwriters\nCategory:Grammy Award winners\nCategory:Latin Grammy Award for Best New Artist\nCategory:Latin Grammy Award winners\nCategory:Latin music songwriters\nCategory:Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year honorees\nCategory:Musicians from Medell\u00edn\nCategory:People named in the Panama Papers\nCategory:Universal Music Latin Entertainment artists\nCategory:Wrasse Records artists\nCategory:21st-century Colombian male singers\nCategory:Spanish-language singers of Colombia",
