He began his career as a flautist making his debut at the Salzburg Festival at the age of twenty with I Solisti Veneti. After study with  the Italian conductor Piero Bellugi, Conti gave up his career as a flautist to concentrate on conducting. He was the principal conductor of the Turin Philharmonic Orchestra from 2001 to 2005. He went on to become the Principal conductor of the Teatro Marrucino in Chieti and the National Chamber Orchestra of Andorra. From 2011 to 2017 he was the Principal conductor of the Oviedo Filarmonia in Spain. He received the Gold Medal of the Auditorio Pr\u00edncipe Felipe de Oviedo.s.n. (27 April 2017). \"Marzio Conti deja la titularidad de la Oviedo Filarmon\u00eda... y la direcci\u00f3n orquestal\". Codalario. Retrieved 25 February 2019 . He has also served several times on Jury of the Arts in the Princess of Asturias Awards.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002 he was principal conductor at the Istituzione Sinfonica Abruzzese in Italy, responsible for a major period of artistic growth and international prestige that led to a series of recordings and frequent tours in Italy, France, and Spain.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2004, Conti was music director of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Turin. He infused the programming with new life and helped bring about a growth in subscriptions, and began a series of initiatives that brought the orchestra more in touch with civic life in Turin. His recordings with the orchestra drew praise from critics, and he and the orchestra toured France, Germany and Spain. He forged a partnership with the French city of Lyon which lead the orchestra in a historic Requiem Dvorak National Auditorium of the same city. Under his leadership, the orchestra became known throughout Europe with frequent tours in Italy, France, Germany and Spain.\n\nFrom 2003 until 2008, Conti was Music Director of the Teatro di Tradizione per l\u2019Opera Italiana of Chieti. He brought a series of recordings in collaboration with Naxos focused on Italian opera: Rossini\u2019s Il Turco in Italia, Donizetti\u2019s La Figlia del Reggimento etc. Chieti's theater participated in numerous television programs in the most important opera broadcasts nationwide and created a network of partnerships with other Italian theaters, including those of Pisa, Lucca, Livorno, Jesi,\n\nand Ravenna, that led to lower costs for the various opera productions. Notable amongst these programs was\"The Concert for Peace\" from King David Auditorium Tel Aviv (Israel).\n\nFrom 2004 to 2010 Conti also served as Artistic Director of the Orchestra Sinfonica di Sanremo, taking over the orchestra at a time of economic crisis and image problems. He raised funds, established connections with other institutions, and attracted a new, younger audience which raised the orchestra\u2019s profile and quality enough to bring it to the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, securing a recording contract with Naxos and residency at the Nice Summer Festival, home of the prestigious international summer academy, where he had previously held the chair of flute studies after Jean-Pierre Rampal and Alain Marion. Another notable achievement in Sanremo was his creation of the musical West Side Story made exclusively with high school youth who had never before made music. Prepared during the school year, the work was a great success with audiences and critics alike and was instrumental in adding new subscribers to the orchestra.\n\nSince 2014, he has collaborated as guest conductor and professor with Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University and since 2017 he is guest principal conductor of the AIMS Festival in Graz.\n\nRecordings\nConti has recorded Warner International, Naxos Records, Chandos Records, Real Sound Records, Classic Produktion Osnabr\u00fcck and Brilliant Records.\n \nNaxos include:\nRossini: Il turco in Italia\nRendine:Passio et Resurrectio\nRendine: Symphonies 1 & 2\nDonizetti: La fille du r\u00e9giment\nCimarosa: Il matrimonio segreto\n\nChandos include:\nNino Rota \"Suite dal balletto \"La strada\", Sinfonia sopra una canzone d'amore, Ballabili dal Gattopardo\nNino Rota  Sinfonie\nNino Rota Concerti\n\nCPO recordings include:\nRespighi \"La pentola magica\", \"La sensitiva\",\"Aretusa\"\nRespighi  \"La boutique fantasque\" \u2013 Uccelli\nG.F.

According to Murkomen's law firm the money was used to buy land in Eldoret on behalf of a client of the law firm who is also a reported suspect of the scam. The National Assembly public accounts committee that was investigating the matter demanded the law firm produce a land sale agreement and documents showing instructions for property purchase but the law firm declined citing confidentiality. Murkomen was reported to send insulting short text messages to committee members for demanding the documents. According to the committee there was no proof any land was bought using NYS scam share of loot sent to Murkomen's law firm account and he was politicizing the matter without accounting for the specific money the law firm was accused of receiving.\n\nIn the same month, December 2016 Oscar Sudi and former Nandi Hills Member of Parliament, Alfred Keter demanded that Murkomen carry his own cross in the scam, and that he should specifically explain how he received Sh 100 million ($900,000) from the NYS scam that he used to buy properties in Elgon View estate in Eldoret without dragging other Rift valley members of parliament into the scam or seeking sympathy from them.\n\nIn February 2016 Anne Waiguru filed an affidavit in court claiming Murkomen and William Ruto's then aide as Deputy president Farouk Kibet were part of a larger cartel that stole money from the NYS scam using fraudulent tendering. Following the affidavit EACC summoned Murkomen and Farouk Kibet over the scam. In April 2016 Anne Waiguru and another suspect in the scam Josephine Kabura filed further affidavits claiming that Murkomen had warned them to tell DCI to drop the investigations or face unspecified consequences.\n\nIn August 2018 Murkomen claimed Raila Odinga also pocketed a share of the NYS scam funds amounting to Ksh 100 million ($900,000) through Junet Mohammed who received money through questionable NYS contracts with Junet's companies. Murkomen claimed Junet took some of the money to Raila Odinga.\nIn May 2020 a Nairobi High court found that the Public Accounts committee of Parliament of Kenya had no power to recommend to the DPP to prosecute the matter as its not an investigative agency.\n\n Personal life \nMurkomen is married to Gladys Wanjiru Kipchumba and is a father to three sons and a daughter.\n\nMurkomen is a supporter of English Premier League club Manchester United.https://www.teamkenya.co.ke/news/4737-top-kenyan-politicians-and-teams-they-follow-epl\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1979 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:21st-century Kenyan lawyers\nCategory:Kenya School of Law alumni\nCategory:University of Nairobi alumni\nCategory:University of Pretoria alumni\nCategory:People from Elgeyo-Marakwet County\nCategory:Members of the Senate of Kenya\nCategory:Jubilee Party politicians",

Subsequently, he engaged in tiatrs, a customary type of Goan theater, at the community level in nearby villages.\n\nCareer\nCoelho's entry into the professional tiatr theater scene occurred later in his career compared to many of his contemporaries. While the majority of tiatrists embark on their stage careers during their youth, Coelho's initial performance on the professional tiatr stage occurred circa 1990 when he was 33 years old. During that era, the majority of tiatrs featured artists predominantly hailing from the regions of Bardez and Salcete. Prior to this professional debut, Coelho had participated in annual natak (dramatic performance) productions in the late 1970s. He subsequently shifted his focus to creating and overseeing the production of his own tiatrs, which were showcased during the yearly celebration in his native village of Muxer-Bandora, Goa situated in the Ponda taluka area. Coelho's talent caught the eye of a relative named Jackferns, who was a tiatr contractor, promoter, and businessman based in Vasco da Gama, Goa. Jackferns facilitated an introduction between Coelho and the established tiatrist Manuel Pereira, which resulted in Coelho securing a role in Pereira's 1986 tiatr production named Ghorabo (Family). Coelho engaged in two of Pereira's theatrical shows before assuming a role in Patrick Dourado's 1988 tiatr production named Nomoskar (Greetings). In addition to his initial professional experiences, Coelho took on acting roles for well-known tiatrists like Anthony San. Following this, he initiated the production of his independent commercial tiatr shows, debuting with Tum Pasun (You Too) in the year 1992.\n\nCoelho had an extensive career in tiatr productions, in the post-1990s period, wherein he performed in tiatrs directed by some of the popular Konkani stage directors, including Patrick Dourado, Jose Rod, Prince Jacob, Roseferns, Menino de Bandar, Chris Perry, Mariano Fernandes, and John D' Silva, among others. Coelho's portrayal of the comedic character \"Hoddo Bakru\" in the tiatr Mauli (Gardener) directed by Jose Rod was particularly well received. The comedic persona, a thrifty landlord character known as a \"bhatcar,\" typically seen seated in his armchair on his \"balcao\" or veranda, is famous for engaging in frequent quarrels with neighbors over minor matters, had become so well known that the nickname 'Hoddo Bakru' is now a lasting moniker for Coelho. Coelho's artistic endeavors extend beyond the stage, encompassing roles in a variety of VCDs (video compact discs) and full-length feature films, apart from managing the production and direction of his personal VCDs. \"Since 1999, he founded his own theatrical group where he has taken on roles as a playwright, director, and producer of tiatrs that frequently examine family themes and deliver strong messages to the audience,\" writes Elvis Sequeira of O Heraldo. These productions are infused with humor, showcasing the lively on-stage chemistry between Coelho and his brother, Luis Bachan, who is also a popular Konkani stage comedian.\n\nIn October 2010, Coelho's tiatr Novo Suria Udetana was launched towards the end of the month. He has staged his theatrical productions both domestically and internationally over the course of his career. Coelho has performed his works extensively abroad, touring countries such as Portugal, Germany, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and various nations in the Persian Gulf region on multiple occasions. Additionally, he has entertained audiences in various regions across multiple states in his homeland of India. In May 2016, Coelho collaborated with his brother Luis Bachan to debut a new tiatr called Ami Soglim Ek (We Are One). This theatrical presentation celebrated the roles of a housewife and a young girl child, a theme that marked a significant production in the tiatr oeuvre of Coelho, his 20th production. The ensemble cast included Priscilla as Joyce, portraying the housewife, Sonali as a childlike character, Olga as the village belle, Michael as the local administrative officer (mamlatdar), Elias portrayed the character of the headstrong son, while Rons took on the role of a vigilant officer. Anil Pednekar's portrayal brought to life the character of Pandurang, embodying the villainous essence of the role on stage, while Coelho and Luis Bachan brought to life a comedic pair of freeloaders in this performance. The siblings also contributed their vocal talents to the tiatr.\n\nIn the past, Coelho would typically produce and stage only a single tiatr per year. However, beginning in May 2016, the size and talent of the acting troupe assembled by Coelho enabled him to increase his annual tiatr output to two productions per year. Coelho has continued to write, direct, and star in new tiatr works. In December 2018, he released a tiatr titled Housewife, in which he not only assumed a comedic role but also sang. He portrayed a comedic character alongside his sibling Luis Bachan, with the comedy duo being assisted by up-and-coming amateur performers Avilla and Cassy. Coelho's comedic talents and stage presence in this production were noted by theatre critics to evoke comparisons to the popular Konkani tiatr comedian Anthony Mendes. More recently, in November 2023, Coelho premiered a new tiatr called Flying Kiss. This theatrical work focused on themes of family relationships and the importance of mutual support within a family unit, including between in-laws. The cast featured both established tiatr performers as well as newer, up-and-coming artists. As with Housewife, Coelho took on a key comedic role in the production, this time alongside other players. The ensemble featured performers such as Rosario Botelho, Priscilla, Manuel, Denzilia Menezes, Ubaldo, and Sonali Naik. Coelho took on the role of a comedian alongside Lino, Lanessa, and Joylan, as well as performing as a duo with Lino.\n\nPersonal life\nCoelho's younger brother, known by his stage name Luis Bachan, is also active in the Konkani entertainment scene as a comedian.\n\nStyle\nCoelho's tiatrs, traditional Konkani-language theater performances, typically center around subjects concerning family dynamics and interpersonal connections, steering clear of addressing political matters. In his capacity as a government employee, Coelho opts to steer away from incorporating contentious political themes in his tiatrs. He abstains from openly criticizing individuals during performances, opting to provide guidance in private if the situation necessitates it. In his tiatr writing process, Coelho first develops an outline or conceptual framework for a new work, which he then expands into a full script over the course of approximately 15 days.\n \nCoelho chooses to input the script directly by typing it rather than writing it by hand, citing increased efficiency as the rationale for this preference. Subsequently, his acting troupe engages in an intensive 10-day rehearsal period to prepare thoroughly for the new production. A distinguishing element of Coelho's directorial approach is his focus on incorporating and training young, amateur actors in his tiatrs. He sees this as a significant challenge, as many aspiring performers, while possessing strong vocal abilities, lack experience in effective stage delivery and require guidance to develop their performance skills. Coelho demonstrates a preference for working with inexperienced young actors over established professionals, as he has found the latter to be more resistant to refining or altering their acting styles.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1957 births\nCategory:Goan people\nCategory:Tiatrists\nCategory:People from South Goa district\nCategory:Dramatists and playwrights from Goa",

He then entered the men's absolute division, where he lost by decision to Giancarlo Bodoni in the opening round.\n\nMixed martial arts record\n\n|-\n|Loss\n|align=center|12\u20137\n|Mukhamed Kokov\n|Decision (split)\n|ACA 180\n|\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|5:00\n|Grozny, Russia\n|\n|-\n|Loss\n|align=center|12\u20136\n|Ali Abdulkhalikov\n|Decision (unanimous)\n|ACA 176\n|\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|5:00\n|Ufa, Russia\n|\n|-\n|Win\n|align=center|12\u20135\n|Rasul Magomedov\n|Decision (unanimous)\n|ACA 164\n|\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|5:00\n|Grozny, Russia\n|\n|-\n|Win\n|align=center|11\u20135\n|Aurel P\u00eertea\n|TKO (punches and knee)\n|ACA 155\n|\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|4:59\n|Minsk, Belarus\n|\n|-\n|Loss\n|align=center|10\u20135\n|Artem Reznikov\n|Decision (unanimous)\n|ACA 140\n|\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|5:00\n|Sochi, Russia\n|\n|-\n|Loss\n|align=center|10\u20134\n|Arman Tsarukyan\n|Decision (unanimous)\n|UFC Fight Night: Figueiredo vs. Benavidez 2 \n|\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|5:00\n|Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\n|\n|-\n|Loss\n|align=center|10\u20133\n|Islam Makhachev\n|Decision (unanimous)\n|UFC 242 \n|\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|5:00\n|Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\n|\n|-\n|Win\n|align=center|10\u20132\n|Austin Hubbard\n|Decision (unanimous)\n|UFC Fight Night: dos Anjos vs. Lee \n|\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|5:00\n|Rochester, New York, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n|align=center| 9\u20132\n|John Gunther\n|Submission (rear-naked choke)\n|UFC Fight Night: The Korean Zombie vs. Rodr\u00edguez \n|\n|align=center| 1\n|align=center| 1:57\n|Denver, Colorado, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n|align=center| 8\u20132\n|Nick Hein\n|Submission (rear-naked choke)\n|UFC 224\n|\n|align=center| 1\n|align=center| 4:15\n|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 7\u20132\n| Chris Gruetzemacher\n| Submission (rear-naked choke)\n| UFC Fight Night: Swanson vs. Ortega\n| \n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 0:50\n| Fresno, California, United States\n| \n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 6\u20132\n| S\u00e9rgio Moraes\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| UFC Fight Night: Belfort vs. Gastelum\n| \n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Fortaleza, Brazil\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 6\u20131\n| Nick Piedmont\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| Phoenix FC 1\n| \n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Zouk Mikael, Lebanon\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 5\u20131\n| Mike Flach\n| Submission (rear-naked choke)\n| RFA 42: Giagos vs. Estrazulas\n| \n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 4:07\n| Visalia, California, United States\n|\n|-\n|  Loss\n| align=center| 4\u20131\n| David Rickels\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| Bellator 130\n| \n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Mulvane, Kansas, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 4\u20130\n| Claudiere Freitas\n| Submission (armbar)\n| Talent MMA Circuit 8\n| \n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 3:07\n| Valinhos, Brazil\n| \n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 3\u20130\n| Jos\u00e9 Alberto Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez\n| TKO (punches)\n| EFA: Mexico vs. Brazil\n| \n| align=center| N/A\n| align=center| N/A\n| Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, Mexico\n| \n|-\n|  Win\n| align=center| 2\u20130\n| Rony Silva\n| Submission (guillotine choke)\n| Nitrix Champion Fight 16\n| \n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 1:03\n| Americana, Brazil\n| \n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 1\u20130\n| Juan Manuel Puig\n| Submission\n| CXC: Battle at the Beach\n| \n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 0:36\n| Cabo San Lucas, Mexico\n|\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCategory:Brazilian male mixed martial artists\nCategory:Lightweight mixed martial artists\nCategory:Mixed martial artists utilizing Brazilian jiu-jitsu\nCategory:Martial artists from Rio de Janeiro (city)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1986 births\nCategory:Ultimate Fighting Championship male fighters\nCategory:Brazilian practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu\nCategory:People awarded a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu\nCategory:21st-century Brazilian sportsmen",

        "text": "Nathan Tinkler (born 1 February 1976) is an Australian mining industry executive and was previously the principal shareholder of Aston Resources and Whitehaven Coal.  He started out as a mining apprentice in the Hunter Valley, in New South Wales and set up his own business at age 26. Much of his wealth was acquired from investments in the mining industry.\n\nBiography\nTinkler qualified as an electrician at the Muswellbrook TAFE and commenced his involvement in the coal industry as an apprentice electrical fitter for Bayswater Coal. At aged 26, he started his own mine machinery maintenance business called Custom Mining.\n\nIn 2006, Tinkler paid a $1 million deposit to buy the Middlemount coal mine in Central Queensland. A year later, he sold his Middlemount stake to Macarthur Coal for $275 million with the payment largely in shares. In May 2008 Tinkler sold his Macarthur shares for A$422\u00a0million in cash.\n\nTinkler was named by BRW magazine in September 2008 as Australia\u2019s richest person aged 40 or less with a stated net worth of $441 million at age 32.\n\nIn 2008, Tinkler purchased the Maules Creek Mine coal deposit in New South Wales for $480 million from Rio Tinto and floated the vehicle for the deposit, Aston Resources Limited, in 2010 with a valuation of $1.2 billion.\n\nIn early 2012, Tinkler was named by BRW magazine as Australia\u2019s youngest billionaire with a\nstated net worth of more than $1.18 billion.\n\nIn May 2012, Tinkler merged Aston Resources Limited and another coal mining company controlled by him, Boardwalk Resources, with Whitehaven Coal creating a leading independent coal mining company with market capitalisation in excess of $5 billion.\n\nIn June 2013, Tinkler\u2019s shareholding in Whitehaven Coal was sold to his main financial backers.\n\nIn 2014, Tinkler was called to give evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption over allegations of illegal donations to New South Wales politicians. He denied any wrongdoing and no corruption finding was made against him.\n\nTinker was appointed Managing Director of Australian Pacific Coal Limited in 2015.\n\nIn February 2016, Tinkler was declared bankrupt by the Federal Court with his bankruptcy subsequently annulled in August 2018.\n\nIn December 2018, entities associated with Tinkler commenced proceedings in the New South Wales Supreme Court against Whitehaven Coal seeking compensation in relation to the 2012 acquisition of Boardwalk Resources Limited.\n\nOther business interests\n\nIn 2008, Tinkler established a racehorse enterprise, Patinack Farm, which became one of Australia\u2019s largest locally owned racing organisations, experiencing tremendous success in a short period of time. This success is highlighted by eight individual Group1 winners, more than 40 stake winners and over 200 metropolitan victories.\n\nPatinack Farm consisted of three major properties including Sandy Hollow a 3,300 acre breeding facility, a 1,000 acre training facility and stud at Canungra on the Gold Coast and 950 acres of undeveloped horse country at Monegeeta, Victoria.  Patinack Farm owned as many as 600 broodmares, along with some of the highest potential stallions in Australia.  Tinkler sold Patinack Farm in 2014.\n\nSporting interests\n\nThe Newcastle Jets hosted a community day at which 10,000 fans were admitted free for the clash against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. Membership of the club increased to over 10,000 and the club obtained the Hunter Medical Research Institute as a new sponsor.\n\nOn 31 March 2011 Tinkler assumed ownership of the Newcastle Knights rugby league club by a landslide vote of the eligible club members. The Knights signed Wayne Bennett to a four-year coaching contract with the club, starting in 2012.\n\nIn April 2012 Tinkler handed back the Newcastle Jets A-league licence to the FFA. The Federation said that Tinkler's Hunter Sports Group could not just hand back its licence, and was breaching a binding contract by walking away from the Jets. Federation chief executive Ben Buckley refused to rule out the possibility of launching a damages claim against Tinkler that could go as high as $80\u00a0million.\n\nIn May 2015, after Newcastle Jets players and staff had not been paid for a month, Tinkler placed the Newcastle Jets into voluntary administration, listing debts of $2.7\u00a0million.  That resulted in the Football Federation of Australia terminating Tinkler's A-League licence, held by Hunter Sports Group. It was the culmination of a soccer season in which the Jets recorded their worst-ever results on the way to collecting the competition's wooden spoon.\n\n Corruption allegations \nAt a hearing of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on 28 April 2014, it was revealed that Tinkler's Patinack Farm horse stud paid $66,000 to \"Eightbyfive\", a slush fund set up by an advisor to the allegedly corrupt NSW politician Chris Hartcher. A few days later, text messages presented at the commission revealed that Tinkler's property development company, Buildev, had secretly paid $50,000 to produce anonymous flyers attacking Jodi McKay, the local state parliamentarian, in the lead-up to the 2011 state election, because she opposed the billion-dollar plan by Buildev to establish a coal export terminal in Newcastle.\n\n Financial difficulties \nOn Melbourne Cup day 2012, Tinkler's private horse racing trainer, John Thompson, revealed that Tinkler's stable of horses had been forced to go without feed because the group was unable to pay suppliers. Thompson also said that Tinkler's racing and breeding company, Patinack Farm, had been asked to leave its Hawkesbury private training facility because \"the owner of the property just got sick of us being late with our rent\". However a spokesman for Tinkler said Patinack Farm had never run out of feed.\n\nIn December 2012, the Australian Taxation Office filed court documents to wind up Tinkler's Hunter Sports Group. The action came two weeks after two of Tinkler's companies were placed into liquidation. Hunter Sports Group owed around A$2.7 million in unpaid taxes and was notified of this debt in September 2012.\n\nOn 18 February 2013, it was reported that the liquidator of Nathan Tinkler's private company, Patinack Farm Administration, was considering an insolvent trading claim against Tinkler and his fellow director Troy Palmer. On 2 April 2013 it was revealed that Tinkler had put his entire racing and breeding business up for sale, including stock and properties.\n\nIn May 2013, it was reported that Tinkler and his wife could be made bankrupt over A$440,000 in allegedly unpaid bills to a corporate adviser. In the same month, the BRW Rich 200 estimated that Tinkler was beset by a series of debt problems and falling asset values that devalued his 2012 net wealth of A$915 million to A$235 million.\n\nOn 19 June 2013, it was announced that Tinkler's biggest remaining asset, a 19 per cent share in coal miner Whitehaven, had been bought by his main financial backers, including Farallon Management. It was estimated that the sale price of $2.96 per share represented a substantial loss by Tinkler's backers on their loans to him. Nevertheless, the sale of his share in Whitehaven was seen as part of his struggle to repay debts accumulated by other parts of his crumbling empire. The funds raised by the sale of his Whitehaven shares enabled Tinkler to repay a $12 million debt to coal exploration company Blackwood Resources on 27 June, a day ahead of schedule.\n\nOn 3 September 2013, Tinkler's company, Aston Metals, a base metals explorer then owning five projects around Mt Isa, was placed in the hands of receivers.\n\nOn 21 May 2014, it was reported that contracts had been exchanged to sell Patinack Farm, for an undisclosed sum, to a consortium consisting of \"local and overseas parties from the Middle East\".\n\nOn 20 July 2015, an arrest warrant was ordered for Tinkler after he failed to appear in the Supreme Court in Adelaide to answer questions about the liquidation of his Patinack horse farm. The liquidator had taken action in the South Australian Supreme Court over unpaid debts, and asked the court to issue a warrant for Tinkler's arrest, saying he had shown a \"flagrant disregard\" for the court.\n\nOn 19 and 20 November of the same year, Tinkler was served with two statutory demands by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, alleging that his company, Aston Resources Investments, owed $6.4 million in tax, and that Tinkler Group Holdings Administration owed $3.5 million. On 9 February 2016, he was the subject of a bankruptcy hearing over a $2.8 million debt to GE Commercial Finance relating to the sale of his private jet aeroplane. Federal Court judge, Jacqueline Gleeson, ruled GE was entitled to make Tinkler, then resident in Singapore, bankrupt, but stayed the order pending an urgent appeal. On 2 March 2016, Tinkler failed to lodge an appeal in the required time and so was officially declared bankrupt. He told his bankruptcy trustee that he only had one asset, a farm near the NSW north coast town of Port Macquarie, which has caveats held on it by retailer Gerry Harvey and the local council.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Australian businesspeople\nCategory:Australian soccer chairmen and investors\nCategory:1976 births\nCategory:Rugby league chairmen and investors\nCategory:People from the Hunter Region\nCategory:V8 Utes drivers",

        "text": "Joshua James LeRibeus (born July 2, 1989) is an American former professional football player who was a center in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Southern Methodist University and was selected by the Washington Redskins in third round of the 2012 NFL draft. LeRibeus was also a member of the Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nProfessional career\n\nWashington Redskins\nLeRibeus was selected 71st overall in the 2012 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins. While at SMU, he was a teammate of future Redskins teammates Richard Crawford, who the Redskins would later draft in the seventh round, and Aldrick Robinson, who was the Redskins' sixth round pick in 2011. After the Redskins' rookie mini-camp, head coach Mike Shanahan announced that LeRibeus will primarily be playing guard and will be a backup center, providing competition for Erik Cook. On July 18, 2012, he officially signed with the Redskins to a four-year contract. During training camp, he split snaps at the left guard position with Maurice Hurt after Kory Lichtensteiger had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. He made his NFL debut against the Carolina Panthers in Week 9. Despite playing only five games, Redskins coaching staff believed LeRibeus had a chance to compete for a starting position in the next season.\n\nDuring the 2013 offseason training camp, LeRibeus came 30 pounds overweight and out of shape. He was listed as inactive for the entire 2013 season.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, LeRibeus re-signed with the Redskins. He was released on September 3, 2016.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nOn January 11, 2017, LeRibeus signed a reserve/future contract with the Eagles. On May 4, 2017, he was released by the Eagles.\n\nNew Orleans Saints\nOn May 15, 2017, LeRibeus signed with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nOn May 18, 2018, LeRibeus re-signed with the Saints. He played in six games, starting three at left guard in place of the injured Andrus Peat, before suffering an ankle injury in Week 7. He was placed on injured reserve on October 24, 2018.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nOn June 28, 2019, LeRibeus signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was released during final roster cuts on August 30, 2019.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1989 births\nCategory:American football centers\nCategory:American football offensive guards\nCategory:New Orleans Saints players\nCategory:Players of American football from Richardson, Texas\nCategory:Philadelphia Eagles players\nCategory:SMU Mustangs football players\nCategory:Players of American football from Collin County, Texas\nCategory:Players of American football from Dallas County, Texas\nCategory:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players\nCategory:Washington Redskins players",

        "text": "Amla Ashok Ruia is an Indian environmentalist known for her work in water harvesting.\n\nCareer\nRuia was inspired by severe droughts in 1999/2000 and 2003 to improve water harvesting in Rajasthan villages. She founded the Aakar Charitable Trust(ACT) to partner with villages to build check dams that provide water security.\n\nHer first check dam project was in Mandawar village, Rajasthan, which was a success. Farmers managed to earn up to 120 million rupees in a year via the two check dams built by Aakar Charitable Trust. By the end of 2017, Aakar Charitable Trust had built more than 200 check dams in more than 115 villages in Rajasthan, with flow-on effects to almost 200 other villages. The Trust provides 60-70% of the resources required to construct each check dam, while the village where the dam is sited provides 30-40% of resources, participates in its construction, and is responsible for its maintenance. The check dams allow the aquifers to be replenished during the monsoon, so that bore wells and hand-pumps are recharged. Villagers have been able to grow up to three crops per year and keep livestock. Ruia estimates that the resulting increased income gives a 750% return on the investment in the check dams. |Girls are able to attend school, as they no longer need to help their mothers carry water from long distances, and students can undertake tertiary education. Ruia is popularly known as Paani Mata (\"Water Mother\").\n\nRuia and her team have extended their efforts in other states such as Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and the Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh, and have plans to expand into Bihar, Haryana, Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn 2011, Ruia was awarded a Lakshmipat Singhania - IIM Lucknow National Leadership Award in the category of Community Service and Social Upliftment. In 2016, she was nominated for the Women of Worth Social Award category. In 2018, she received the India Eye International Human Rights Observer Achievement Award 2018.\n\nPersonal life\nAmla Ruia was born in Uttar Pradesh. She currently lives in Malabar Hill, Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Indian environmentalists\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People from Mumbai\nCategory:Indian women environmentalists\nCategory:Activists from Maharashtra\nCategory:Women educators from Maharashtra\nCategory:Educators from Maharashtra\nCategory:Indian women human rights activists\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)",

Romain has since turned several whole buildings into works of art, transforming many edifices into colourful, Trompe-l'\u0153il, masterpieces. Often the buildings are local authority premises, such as the Saint Mand\u00e9 council offices, Paris, for which Romain won the prize for the world's largest mural in 1990.

        "text": "Kameron Necole Simmonds (born 6 December 2003) is a footballer who plays as a forward or defender for the Florida State Seminoles. Born in the United States, she represents Jamaica internationally.\n\nEarly life\nKameron Necole Simmonds was born on 6 December 2003 in Virginia to Necole and Greg Simmonds. She has three younger brothers. Despite her father being a former footballer, Simmonds only took up the sport when she was unable to continue training in gymnastics after an injury at the age of 11; beginning football the next year, she trained with her father.\n\n College career \nSimmonds played for Richmond United until the summer of 2022 when she began her college soccer career at the University of Tennessee for the Tennessee Volunteers. She chose to join Tennessee due to her parents believing in its values; due to encouragement from Jamaica teammate Giselle Washington, who already attended the university; and being inspired by Jamaica legend and former Volunteer Khadija Shaw.\n\nAs a true freshman, she made two top 100 best freshman lists, having scored four goals in sixteen appearances. Playing as a substitute, the college highlighted her productivity in her limited minutes, often with multiple shots on goal per game.\n\nInternational career\nIn the under-20 national team, Simmonds competed at the 2022 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship with the Jamaican U-20 team. She scored two goals at the tournament, watched by her family.\n\nWhen she made her senior debut on 3 September 2022, in a 0\u20131 friendly loss to South Korea, she became the third generation of her family to represent Jamaica in senior international football after her father, Greg, and grandfather, Patrick.\n\nSimmonds then competed at the 2023 Cup of Nations, where her team finished in fourth place. On 23 June 2023, she was included in the final Jamaica squad for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. She made her World Cup debut in the second group game, coming on for Kayla McKenna in a 1\u20130 victory over Panama.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTennessee Volunteers profile\n\nCategory:2003 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American women's soccer players\nCategory:Women's association football forwards\nCategory:Women's association football defenders\nCategory:Jamaican women's footballers\nCategory:21st-century Jamaican sportswomen\nCategory:Jamaica women's international footballers\nCategory:2023 FIFA Women's World Cup players\nCategory:Tennessee Volunteers women's soccer players\nCategory:Soccer players from Virginia\nCategory:People from Chesterfield County, Virginia\nCategory:21st-century American sportswomen\nCategory:Florida State Seminoles women's soccer players",

        "text": "Kumar Prabhakar Barve (; born September 8, 1958) is an American Democratic Party politician. He is a member of the Maryland Public Service Commission, to which he was appointed by Governor Wes Moore in May 2023. He was previously a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing district 17 in Montgomery County, from 1991 to 2023. He was the first Indian-American to be elected to a state legislature in the United States. From 2002 to 2015, Barve served as Majority Leader of the House of Delegates.\n\nHis legislative work focused largely on protecting the environment, improving health care, and the promotion of the high-tech industry in Maryland. In 2015, he was appointed to chair the House Environment and Transportation Committee, which oversees transportation, the environment, agriculture, ethics, and housing and real property law. He sponsored both the 1995 Health Access Act that place limits on HMOs for the first time and legislation that created the Technology Development Corporation of Maryland.\n\nHe unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2016 in Maryland's 8th congressional district, losing the Democratic Primary to the eventual winner, State Senator Jamie Raskin.\n\nPersonal life\nBarve was born on September 8, 1958, in Schenectady, New York, to Indian-American parents. The family later moved to Maryland, where he attended Paint Branch High School in Silver Spring. In 1980, Barve graduated from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with a B.S. degree in Accounting.\n\nLegislative career\nBarve was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1990, finishing third in the contest for district 17's three seats behind incumbents Jennie M. Forehand and Mike Gordon but ahead of four other challengers. As a result of his victory, Barve became the first Indian-American to serve in a state legislature. He took office in January, 1991, and was appointed to the House Economic Matters Committee, which considers legislation related to business and labor policy and regulation.\n\nAfter his first re-election in 1994, Barve rose in leadership with his appointment as chair of a subcommittee, first the Real Property subcommittee in 1995 and 1996, and later the Science and Technology Subcommittee from 1997 to 2003. Also in 1995, he was elected to chair the Montgomery County Delegation to Annapolis. Barve was re-elected in 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nFollowing the election of a new Speaker, Michael E. Busch, in 2003, Barve was appointed to serve as majority leader, the leader of the Democratic majority and second in command to the Speaker. He served for two years on the Environmental Matters Committee before moving again to the Ways and Means Committee, where he oversaw tax policy as Chair of the Revenues Subcommittee from 2007 to 2010. In additional, he serves on a number of major joint committees, including the Legislative Policy Committee, Spending Affordability Committee, as chair of the Joint Information Technology and Biotechnology Committee, and as house chair of the Joint Committee on Transparency and Open Government.\n\nIn 2015, Barve left his post as majority leader to become chair of the renamed Environment and Transportation Committee. His appointment coincided with the election of a new Republican Governor, Larry Hogan and debate over a number of significant environmental issues. Among the significant pieces of legislation Barve's committee worked on in the first year of the new term were a moratorium and public health study on fracking, a major reform to the state's stormwater protection fee, and debate over regulations which will require farms to severely limit the phosphorus that runs from their lands into the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBarve's work as a legislator over the length of his career has focused on a broad range of issues. In 1995, he successfully sponsored the first state bill in the nation to regulate HMOs, the Maryland Health Access Act of 1995. The act allows health care patients to see doctors outside of the network of HMO providers, ensures that HMOs can't bar providers from sharing information if it jeopardizes patient care, and prohibits the use of financial incentives by HMOs that curtail and compromise care. He later co-sponsored the law that bars insurance companies based in Maryland from using pre-existing conditions to deny coverage.\n\nBarve has also worked extensively on the promotion of technology and of high tech businesses. He authored Maryland's version of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA). The Act both affirms the intellectual-property rights of software developers and provides unprecedented consumer protections to purchasers of computer equipment. He sponsored legislation that created the Technology Development Corporation of Maryland, which promotes high-technology business development in Maryland.\nIn 1999, Barve's bill to define the powers of corporations in making certain gifts passed both houses and was signed by the governor.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Barve endorsed Barack Obama for president.\n\nOn April 6, 2023, Governor Wes Moore announced he would appoint Barve to the Maryland Public Service Commission. He resigned from the Maryland House of Delegates on May 1, 2023.\n\nControversies\nIn November 2007, Barve was cited by Gaithersburg Police for driving under the influence of alcohol while operating a vehicle. On July 17, 2008, Barve pleaded guilty and received a probation before judgement, and suspension of all but $200 of a $1,000 fine.\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that Barve and his wife were inappropriately receiving a Homestead Property Tax Credit on two properties that they had owned separately prior to their marriage. Barve indicated that he had assumed Anne Arundel County would delete the tax credit on the property his wife had owned prior to their marriage once the couple declared his residence in Gaithersburg to be their primary joint residence. While early reports were critical of Barve, the Associate Director of Assessments and Taxation for Maryland later told reporters than nothing improper had taken place, and that such errors had occurred repeatedly in cases where individuals owned homes and then later married. Barve pledged that he would re-pay any money that the couple did not pay earlier due to the error.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Asian-American state legislators in Maryland\nCategory:Democratic Party members of the Maryland House of Delegates\nCategory:McDonough School of Business alumni\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American politicians of Indian descent\nCategory:Politicians from Schenectady, New York\nCategory:1958 births\nCategory:Place of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:People from Gaithersburg, Maryland\nCategory:2012 United States presidential electors\nCategory:Candidates in the 2016 United States elections\nCategory:21st-century members of the Maryland General Assembly\nCategory:20th-century members of the Maryland General Assembly",

        "text": "Kimberly Jean Brown (born November 16, 1984)  See also: is an American actress. She is best known for her leading role as teen witch Marnie Cromwell in the Halloweentown film series (1998\u20132004), co-starring Debbie Reynolds.\n\nBrown first gained recognition for her portrayal of Marah Lewis in the CBS soap opera Guiding Light (1993\u20131998, 2006), which earned her a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series. She garnered further critical acclaim for her performance as Ava Walker in the comedy-drama film Tumbleweeds (1999), for which she won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. Brown also starred as Annie Wheaton in the ABC horror miniseries Rose Red (2002), which was written by Stephen King. She appeared in the comedy film Bringing Down the House (2003), the horror film Big Bad Wolf (2006), and the comedy film Friendship! (2010).\n\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Brown began her career at age five.Riggs, Thomas, ed. (2010). Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television. Volume 103. Detroit, Mich. : Gale. p.\u00a038. . By the time she was 11, she had enjoyed success as a child model with Ford Models, performed in multiple Broadway shows and earned an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Marah Lewis on Guiding Light. She found work as a voice actress, lending her voice to commercials, A Bug's Life, and the English dub of Vampire Princess Miyu.\n\nAt 13, Brown was cast in her most notable film to date, the Disney Channel Original Movie Halloweentown. In the movie, she played 13-year-old Marnie Piper, a young witch who is determined to learn magic from her grandmother Aggie, portrayed by Debbie Reynolds. In September 2016, Brown recalled an audition for the film in which she had to react to a conversation when it was revealed that the character Marnie is a witch. Brown read for the role twice before being cast. Halloweentown aired on October 17, 1998 and was well received by audiences, leading Disney Channel to produce three sequels; Brown reprised her role as Marnie in two of them. She was replaced by Sara Paxton in the fourth installment, Return to Halloweentown, a decision over which Brown expressed confusion and disappointment. Fans of the franchise were unhappy with Paxton's portrayal of the character, reflected in BuzzFeed writing that the fourth movie, with its \"False Marnie\", is best left ignored, and MTV News writing that fans should act as if the fourth film had never happened. Outside of Halloweentown, Brown also starred in another Disney Channel original movie, the 2000 film Quints. In 1999, Brown co-starred with Janet McTeer in Tumbleweeds which received positive reviews.\n\nIn May 2021, it was announced she had joined the cast of General Hospital.\n\nOther ventures\nBrown and a friend run the Etsy shop CraftilyCreative, which sells a variety of items, including Halloweentown-themed merchandise.\n\nIn 2016, Brown published a Halloween-themed children's book, Poppin's Pumpkin Patch Parade, with co-author Diane Yslas.\n\nPersonal life\nIn a 2010 interview, Brown said that she was close to graduating from college, although she did not disclose what her major was or the school where she was studying. She revealed in 2018 that she had received a Bachelor of Science degree in business.\n\nBrown revealed in 2019 that she has celiac disease.\n\nIn 2016, she reconnected with Halloweentown II co-star Daniel Kountz for a Halloweentown-themed project for Brown's YouTube channel, and they soon began dating. In June 2022, Brown announced they were engaged. In April 2024, the couple were married.\n\n Filmography \n Film \nYearTitleRoleNotes1994Princess CarabooEnglish imposter of Princess CarabooUncredited1998A Bug's LifeFemale Ants (voice)1999TumbleweedsAva Walker 2001Lena/ManilliEnglish dub2003Bringing Down the HouseSarah Sanderson 2005Be CoolTiffany 2006Big Bad WolfSam Marche 2010Friendship!Dorothee \n\nTelevision\nYearTitleRoleNotes1990The Baby-Sitters ClubAmanda DelaneyEpisode: \"The Baby-Sitters Remember\"1993\u20131998, 2006Guiding LightMarah LewisRecurring role1997Vampire Princess MiyuMiyu YamanoVoice role (English dub), 7 episodes1997Ellen FosterDoraTelevision film1998Unhappily Ever AfterHelena, Girl #13 episodes1998HalloweentownMarnie PiperDisney Channel Original Movie1998\u20131999Two of a KindNicole2 episodes1999Touched by an AngelAmy LumpkinEpisode: \"The Last Day of the Rest of Your Life\"2000QuintsJamie GroverDisney Channel Original Movie2001Halloweentown II: Kalabar's RevengeMarnie PiperDisney Channel Original Movie2002My Sister's KeeperYoung Christine ChapmanHallmark Channel Original Movie2002Rose RedAnnie WheatonMiniseries2003Law & Order: Special Victims UnitJessica Morse / Margory MaddoxEpisode: \"Perfect\"2004Halloweentown HighMarnie PiperDisney Channel Original Movie2013Low Winter SunShana Taylor5 episodes2018MondaysOlder KellyEpisode: \"That Time When I Met My Future Self\"2019Crossword Mysteries: Proposing MurderAngelaTelevision film2021General HospitalChloe JenningsRecurring Role2023The Ghost and Molly McGeeBlair (voice)Episode: \"The Unhaunting of Brighton Video\"\n\n Theatre \n Year Title Role Playwright Venue Ref. 1992 Four Baboons Adoring The Sun  Robin  John Guare  Vivian Beaumont Theater, Broadway   1994 Show Boat  Children Ensemble / Young Kim Understudy Jerome Kern / Oscar Hammerstein II Gershwin Theatre, Broadway  \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\nCategory:1984 births\nCategory:Actresses from Maryland\nCategory:American child actresses\nCategory:American film actresses\nCategory:American musical theatre actresses\nCategory:American stage actresses\nCategory:American soap opera actresses\nCategory:American television actresses\nCategory:20th-century American actresses\nCategory:21st-century American actresses\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Halloweentown (film series)",

        "text": "Elo Viiding (pen name, Elo Vee; born 20 March 1974) is an Estonian poet and prose writer.\n\nFamily\nViiding is the third poet in her family. Her father, Juhan Viiding was a famous and influential poet in the 1970s. He was also an actor. Her paternal grandfather, Paul Viiding, was a poet, author and literary critic and member of Arbujad in the 1930s, and her paternal grandmother was translator Linda Viiding. Her maternal grandfather, Kaljo Kiisk, was an actor, film director and politician. Viiding's mother Riina was a music teacher.\n\nEducation\nViiding, inspired by her father's career as an actor and her mother's love for music, graduated from school in 1999 as an actress.  She studied violin.\n\nLiterary career\nViiding debuted under a pseudonym (\"Elo Vee\") in 1991. She published four anthologies under her pseudonym. After her father's death in 1995, she began to publish her works under her real name.\n\nThemes and style\n\nViiding writes mainly about the oppressed. It is her opinion that every person is controlled and oppressed by someone else. She also uses her poetry to address what she sees as shortcomings in the Estonian educational system. She writes directly to her reader and her tone is extremely ironic. When her poetry is compared with that of other Estonian writers, it seems to be more masculine than feminine.\n\nSelected works\n\n collection of poetry \"Telg\" Kassett \u00b4 90 (publisher Eesti Raamat 1990),\n collection of poetry \u201eLaeka l\u00e4hedus\" (publisher Tuum 1993),\n collection of poetry \"V\u00f5lavalgel\" (publisher Tuum 1995),\n collection of prose \"Ingelheim\" (publisher Eesti Raamat 1995),\n collection of poetry \"V\" (publisher Tuum 1998),\n selection of poetry in Finnish \"Paljastuksia\" (translated by Katja Meriluoto, publisher Nihil Interit 2000),\n \u201eKaardipakk\u201c  (poetry with Karl Martin Sinij\u00e4rv, J\u00fcrgen Rooste, Triin Soomets, Asko K\u00fcnnap, published by N\u00e4o Kirik  2001),\n collection of poetry \"Esimene tahe\" (publisher Tuum 2002),\n collection of poetry \"Teatud erandid\" (publisher Tuum 2003),\n selection of poetry in Swedish \"F\u00f6r en st\u00e4mma\" (translator Peeter Puide, publisher Ariel 2004),\n collection of poetry \"Selge j\u00e4lg\" (publisher Tuum 2005),\n \u201eKaardipakk Kaks\u201c  (poetry with Asko K\u00fcnnap, Karl Martin Sinij\u00e4rv, J\u00fcrgen Rooste, Triin Soomets, published by N\u00e4o Kirik 2006),\n collection of short stories \"P\u00fcha Maama\" (publisher Tuum 2008),\n collection of poetry \"Meie paremas maailmas\" (publisher Tuum 2009).\n\nIn anthologies\n\nProse: \"V\u00e4lismaa naised\", (\"Foreign women\") \"Best European Fiction 2010\", Dalkey Archive Press, \nedited by Aleksandar Hemon, translated by Eric Dickens\n\nPoetry: \"Verden Finnes ikke p\u00e5 kartet\" (Poesi fra hele verden), Forlaget Oktober AS, Oslo 2010, edited by Pedro Carmona-Alvarez and Gunnar W\u00e6rness.

        "text": "Luka Krajnc (born 19 September 1994) is a Slovenian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Slovenian PrvaLiga club Maribor.\n\nClub career\nKrajnc began his football career at the age of eight, when his father took him to the Slovenian club Maribor for a trial. He signed his first professional contract with Maribor at the age of 16 and played for the main squad in a couple of friendly matches. On 29 May 2011, he played his first and only 1. SNL match for Maribor in the last round of the 2010\u201311 season, with Maribor already being crowned champions. At the time of his debut, he was the youngest player ever with an appearance for Maribor in a 1. SNL match, a record which lasted until 25 March 2012 when it was surpassed by Petar Stojanovi\u0107.\n\nOn 3 April 2011, Krajnc signed a pre-contract with Italian Serie A club Genoa. The transfer fee paid by Genoa was undisclosed, but was reported to be close to \u20ac1 million. He joined his new club on 1 July 2011 and was assigned to Genoa's youth team, which he also captained, before making his debut for the first team on 27 October 2012 at San Siro in a league match against AC Milan. With 18 years, one month and 14 days, he became the youngest Slovenian player with an appearance in the Italian top division, Serie A.\n\nOn 3 July 2013, he moved to Cesena in a temporary co-ownership deal. In June 2015, Genoa acquired Cesena's share and became the sole owner of the player's rights.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, Krajnc joined Sampdoria on a season-long loan. In the second part of the 2016\u201317 season, he was loaned to Frosinone.\n\nOn 20 June 2018, Frosinone turned Krajnc's loan into a permanent deal for an undisclosed fee.\n\nIn September 2020, he joined Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf on a season-long loan.\n\nOn 24 August 2021, Krajnc joined Hannover 96 on a three-year contract.\n\nOn 23 August 2023, Krajnc returned to Italy and signed a two-year deal with Catanzaro.\n\nAfter 13 years of playing abroad, Krajnc returned to his childhood club Maribor on 7 September 2024 and signed a contract until 2026 with the option for another year.\n\nInternational career\nKrajnc has represented Slovenia at all youth levels from under-16 to under-21. He made his senior international debut on 30 March 2015, replacing Dominic Maroh after 65 minutes in an eventual 1\u20130 friendly defeat against Qatar at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha.\n\nPersonal life\nKrajnc is from Kapla na Kozjaku in the hilly region of northeastern Slovenia near the Austrian border, roughly 37\u00a0km from the city of Maribor. Before moving to Maribor he usually had to study and do his homework on the back seat of his father's car, traveling to and from training.\n\nCareer statistics\n\n+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competitionClubSeasonLeagueNational cupTotalDivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsMaribor2010\u2013111.

        "text": "Stephanie Louise Peacock (born 1986) is a British Labour Party politician who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnsley South, previously Barnsley East, since 2017. She has served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Media, Civil Society and Youth since July 2024. \n\nEarly life and education\nStephanie Peacock was born in 1986 in Birmingham. She obtained a degree in history from Queen Mary University of London, and a master's degree from the Institute of Education, University College London.\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduating Peacock worked as a teacher, before going on to work on adult education in Yorkshire for the shop workers' union USDAW.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2011, she served as the Youth Representative on the Labour Party National Executive Committee. In 2007 she introduced Gordon Brown at the launch of his unopposed campaign to become Labour Leader.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, she worked as a Political Officer for the GMB trade union.\n\nParliamentary career\nAt the 2015 general election, Peacock stood as the Labour Party candidate in Halesowen and Rowley Regis, coming second with 36.2% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP James Morris.\n\n 1st term (2017\u20132019) \nPeacock was elected to Parliament as MP for Barnsley East at the snap 2017 general election with 59.5% of the vote and a majority of 13,283.\n\nHer maiden speech occurred during a Grenfell Tower debate during which she mentioned the local issue of Orgreave.\n\nFrom January 2018 until March 2019 she served as an Opposition Whip. She resigned on 14 March 2019 after defying the whip to vote against an amendment calling for a second Brexit referendum.\n\nIn November 2018, Peacock, alongside fellow Women's Parliamentary Football teammates, Alison McGovern, Tracey Crouch, Louise Haigh and Hannah Bardell, was rebuked by the then Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, for having a 'kickabout' in the House of Commons after Parliamentary business. Bercow said that the \"historic chamber should not be used for this type of activity\".

He is also a producer, singer, and songwriter based in Los Angeles, United States.\n\n Early life \n\nHurwitz was born in 1979 in Israel to American parents Ira and Dr. Judy Lieman-Hurwitz. He began playing the piano at age 7, and took interest in playing the guitar after seeing the instrument being played in the film Back To The Future. Hurwitz claims that, at the time, he was inspired by Israeli artists such as Gidi Gov and Mashina, as well as British artists such as Eric Clapton and Pink Floyd. His parents bought him his first guitar soon afterwards. \n\nOver the ensuing years, Hurwitz continued to teach himself guitar, while learning how to produce live shows. By age 21, he was audio engineer and stage tech in Israel. At age 23, after a terrorist attack in Israel affected him personally, he moved to Los Angeles to be a professional musician.\n\n Los Angeles career \n\nWhile living in Los Angeles, Hurwitz met drummer Randy Cooke, who helped him get his first signed artist gig with singer-songwriter Anna Nalick. Hurwitz then joined Nalick on the road while she promoted her second studio album Shine. He later worked with Enrique Iglesias, Smash Mouth, Gin Blossoms, Chris Wallace, and many more.

        "text": "Rich Paul (born December 16, 1980) is an American sports agent and the founder and chief executive officer of Klutch Sports Group. His most notable client is basketball player LeBron James, with whom he has been a longtime friend. Paul is also co-head of the Sports division at United Talent Agency.\n\nEarly life\nPaul grew up in a one-bedroom apartment above his father's store, R & J Confectionery, on East 125th and Arlington in Forest Hills, a neighborhood on the east side of Cleveland. His father, Rich Paul Sr, enrolled him in the private, fee-paying Benedictine High School, a Catholic school.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Paul was mentored by Distant Replays owner Andy Hyman on selling vintage jerseys. He would buy throwback jerseys from Atlanta and sell them out of his trunk in Cleveland. Paul was a student at the University of Akron when his father was diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 1999. To be closer to him, Paul transferred to Cleveland State. A few months later, his father passed away, and Paul dropped out of school. Paul said: \"He was always telling me my education was important\u00a0... I always wanted to work. But I still probably would have finished school if my father was alive. I never wanted to let him down.\"\n\nIn 2002, he met LeBron James at the Akron\u2013Canton Airport, where James was impressed by Paul's authentic Warren Moon throwback jersey. The two exchanged contact information, and soon Paul had sold James a Magic Johnson Lakers jersey and a Joe Namath Rams jersey.\n\nCareer\nFollowing the 2003 NBA draft, Paul joined James as a part of his small inner circle, along with James' childhood friends Maverick Carter and Randy Mims. He would later start working under Leon Rose, who had negotiated James' extension with the Cavaliers in 2006, at Creative Artists Agency (CAA).\n\nIn 2012, Paul, along with James, left Rose and Creative Artists Agency to start his own agency, Klutch Sports Group.\n\nIn 2013, Paul enlisted noted long-time agent and attorney Mark Termini to run the NBA contract negotiations for Klutch.\n\nBefore the start of the 2017\u201318 season, Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver had told Paul that if he did not sever ties to head coach Earl Watson, who had Paul and the Klutch Sports Group as an agent at the time, he would fire Watson from the team. After the Suns got off to a 0\u20133 start, with two blowout losses (including the worst loss in franchise history and worst season-opening performance in NBA history) being the perfect cover story in mind, Watson was fired on October 22,Suns Relieve Earl Watson of Head Coaching Duties, NBA.com Published October 22, 2017. Accessed October 22, 2017. and replaced on an interim basis by associate head coach Jay Triano for the rest of that season. This story later became part of a subsequent major report on Sarver, which led to his year-long suspension from the NBA and, afterward, Sarver's agreement to sell the Suns and Phoenix Mercury to a new owner.Allegations of racism and misogyny within the Phoenix Suns, ESPN.com\n\nIn June 2019, Paul was featured on the Sports Illustrated cover, which dubbed him \"The King Maker\". In July 2019, United Talent Agency (UTA) said it had invested strategically in Klutch Sports Group and asked Paul to run its Sports division. Jeremy Zimmer, United Talent Agency's chief executive officer (CEO), said they took a \"significant ownership\" in Klutch, but Paul \"maintains control as operator of his business\". Neither Paul nor Zimmer wanted to disclose the value of the financial investment. Paul expanded the division's clients from 4 to 23. In August 2019, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) changed its regulations for agents, requiring them to hold a bachelor's degree. Called the \"Rich Paul Rule\" by the media, it was widely seen as a swipe at Paul for having not graduated from college and for working with a high school prospect Darius Bazley who decided to work as an intern for New Balance for a year before entering the 2019 NBA draft rather than attend Syracuse or even enter the NBA G League like he first planned to do. Paul argued in an op-ed in The Athletic that the rule would prevent people from less prestigious backgrounds, people of color, and those without the funds to attend college from working as agents in the future so NCAA executives could have more control. The NCAA later backed down from the regulation change.\n\nIn 2020, Paul launched Klutch Conversations during the NBA All-Star Weekend with SocialWorks and General Mills to encourage financial literacy among young people. In July 2020, he was appointed to United Talent Agency's board of directors. GQ magazine named Paul \"Power Broker of the Year\" in its December\u2013January 2020 issue. By the conclusion of Termini's tenure at Klutch in 2020, Klutch Sports had a roster of 25 clients, and Termini had led negotiations on over US$1\u00a0billion worth of NBA contracts for said clients. It was around this time Paul picked up the nickname in agency circles, \"Rich\" Paul referring to the commission he began to take in.\n\nIn April 2021, it was announced that Paul had partnered with former Nike executives to form Adopt, a minority-owned marketing and creative agency that assists companies in the sports and wellness sector. The following month, Isaac Chotiner of The New Yorker wrote that Paul \"is known for driving hard bargains for star clients, giving them new power in the N.B.A.\" In August 2021, Paul was reportedly being sued by Nerlens Noel on the grounds of a breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and negligence for his role in turning down a $70\u00a0million contract offer from the Dallas Mavericks in the offseason preceding the 2017\u201318 season. New Balance asked Paul to collaborate on a new release of the NB550 sneaker which went on sale in December 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Paul joined the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) board of trustees. In May 2022, Paul, alongside Bob Iger and eBay, was part of a consortium in a $263\u00a0million strategic investment led by Peter Chernin's The Chernin Group into the pop-culture collectibles company Funko, taking a 25% stake between the four of them. Following this, Paul was appointed advisor to Funko's board of directors, helping the company to \"expand its presence in the music and sports categories\". Paul was fourth on Forbes 2022 \"World's Most Powerful Sports Agents\" list.\n\nPaul and Noel eventually reached a settlement on January 11, 2023. Noel paid full commissions on a $5\u00a0million deal he signed in 2020 with the New York Knicks and withdrew all legal proceedings afterward. In February 2023, Paul launched Klutch Athletics, a new sportswear brand in collaboration with New Balance. In April 2023, he was added to the board of directors of Live Nation Entertainment. Paul wrote a book with Jesse Washington, Lucky Me: A Memoir of Changing the Odds, published in October 2023. It was on The New York Times best-seller list upon its release. In November 2023, Paul resigned from Funko's board of directors following a wave of departures, including CEO Brian Mariotti and other senior executives, as the company recorded a financial loss in the third quarter. In 2023, Variety named Paul to its Variety500 index for the fourth consecutive year as one of the most \"influential business leaders shaping the global media industry\".\n\nIn March 2024, Robinhood chose Klutch Sports Group to \"serve as its agency of record for sports and entertainment partnerships\", appointing Paul to be the company's strategic brand advisor. In the summer of 2024, Paul expanded his scope to Europe by working with co-founder and managing director Bj\u00f6rn Bezemer of Representatives Of Outstanding Footballers (ROOF), Germany's largest soccer player agency. The German agency, which has 150 clients across the European \"Big Five\", was initially acquired by  United Talent Agency and integrated into Klutch Sports Group. Bezemer was appointed head of Klutch Global Football.\n\n Personal life \nPaul has three children. In 2021, he began a relationship with British singer Adele. On August 9, 2024, she announced they were engaged.\n \nHe was included in the 2020 \"Ebony Power 100 List\".\n\n Written works \n \n\nReferences\n\n External links \n \n\nCategory:1980 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:African-American company founders\nCategory:American sports agents\nCategory:Businesspeople from Cleveland\nCategory:Businesspeople from Akron, Ohio",

        "text": "Aaron Michael Maybin (born April 6, 1988) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) and Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, earning consensus All-American honors. He was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft, and also played for the New York Jets.\n\nMaybin's professional football career lasted until 2013, after which he became a full-time professional artist. He is also the founder of Project Mayhem, and the author of the 2017 book Art Activism. He is a teacher at Matthew A. Henson Elementary in his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nCollege career\nMaybin attended Pennsylvania State University, where he played for coach Joe Paterno's Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 2006 to 2008.  He redshirted during the 2006 season. He had 12 tackles, with 4.5 tackles for losses, one forced fumble and one pass breakup in 2007. He was fourth on the team with four sacks and was named to the Sporting News Freshman All-Big Ten team.\n\nMaybin had a breakout season in 2008. He was selected as the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week following a six-tackle, two-sack performance in Penn State's 48\u20137 defeat of Wisconsin, in which he also forced two key fumbles. He was named a Mid-season All-American by Sports Illustrated, College Football News and CBS Sports.

National Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nProfessional career\n\nPre-draft\nOn January 9, 2009, Maybin indicated he would be going pro and make himself available for the 2009 NFL draft. He was projected as a late first round pick.Penn State DE Aaron Maybin Declares for NFL Draft  SI.com, January 13, 2009 Maybin trained for the NFL Scouting Combine at Power Train Sports Performance in Millersville, Pennsylvania.\n\nBuffalo Bills\nOn August 21, 2009, Maybin agreed to a five-year deal with the Buffalo Bills after being drafted with the 11th pick in the first round. He finished the season with 18 tackles and zero sacks while playing in all 16 regular season games during his 2009 rookie year.\n\nIn his second season, through six games he played on only 66 downs with five tackles and zero sacks. He was deactivated as a healthy-scratch for the team's sixth game at Baltimore.\n\nOn August 15, 2011, Maybin was waived by the Bills.\n\nNew York Jets\nThe New York Jets signed Maybin to a one-year contract for the league minimum on August 17, 2011. He was waived on September 4, 2011. Maybin was re-signed by the Jets on September 28, 2011.\n\nIn his first regular season game with the Jets, Maybin recorded his first career sack, a strip-sack, against Joe Flacco on October 2, 2011. Maybin recorded his second career sack, another strip sack, on October 17 against Matt Moore. He recorded another sack for the second consecutive week on October 23 against Philip Rivers.

Maybin, in limited playing time, recorded one tackle and no sacks and was credited with nine quarterback hits through ten games.\n\nCincinnati Bengals\nOn January 25, 2013, Maybin was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals to a Reserve/Future contract.

His first commission as an artist was for the State of Maryland when Maybin was eleven years old. Maybin, one of four children, was one of the first people to attend college in his family. He then continued his art career throughout his NFL tenure. During his career his paintings were a major part of the Hard Knocks reality television show when it covered the Bengals. During this time, Maybin claims to have used the pressure and stress of performing in professional football to influence his artistic output.\n\nMaybin focused on his art full-time after his NFL career, with paintings sold for as much as $20,000 as of 2013, and prints of his original sold online. He has also set about specific artistic projects. For example, following an incident he had with a police officer racial profiling him in Baltimore following in the first two weeks of the death of Freddie Gray, Maybin began a photography project in the surrounding area and painted images of the neighborhood as it reacted to the social trauma.\n\nMaybin's studio is based in Baltimore, Maryland. He is also the founder of \"Project Mayhem\", taking his college football nickname, which performs non-profit artistic activities in the public. The foundation supports the artwork of students in the Baltimore area. In 2017 Maybin released the book Art Activism. In describing the book, The Undefeated wrote, \"The work is both an ode to Maybin's hometown and a lament of the city's many challenges. He uses his paintings, photography, poetry and prose to convey both the pride and pain of Baltimore.\"\n\nPersonal life\nMaybin was born to Constance and Michael Maybin in Baltimore. He was diagnosed with borderline attention deficit disorder when he was young. His parents sought out alternatives to drug treatment which included sketching, sculpting, wrestling, baseball and football, which he began play at the Pee-Wee level at the age of 5. When Maybin was 6, his mother died after going into cardiac arrest during child birth. His father later remarried to an English missionary, Violette Grant, whom Maybin calls his mother. He attended Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City.\n\nWhile at Penn State, Maybin spoke frequently by phone with former Nittany Lion linebacker LaVar Arrington. The two first met during Arrington's stint with the Washington Redskins, when Maybin was playing at nearby Mount Hebron High School. Arrington has joked about knowing Maybin \"before he had muscles.\" Arrington now serves as Maybin's manager.\n\nIn 2009, Maybin founded Project Mayhem, a charitable organization established to \"provide aid, both personal and economic, to help underprivileged and at risk youth excel beyond their current conditions.\"\n\nMaybin's cousin Cameron Maybin played in Major League Baseball.\n\nMaybin was roommates with linebacker NaVorro Bowman while at Penn State. He pursued a double major in communications and integrative arts.  Maybin became a member of the Delta Theta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity in April 2008.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1988 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People from Ellicott City, Maryland\nCategory:Sportspeople from Howard County, Maryland\nCategory:Players of American football from Maryland\nCategory:All-American college football players\nCategory:American football defensive ends\nCategory:American football linebackers\nCategory:Canadian football defensive linemen\nCategory:Penn State Nittany Lions football players\nCategory:Buffalo Bills players\nCategory:New York Jets players\nCategory:Cincinnati Bengals players\nCategory:Toronto Argonauts players\nCategory:Educators from Maryland\nCategory:Players of Canadian football from Maryland",

        "text": "Rodney Cline Carew (born October 1, 1945) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman, first baseman and designated hitter from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins and the California Angels. The most accomplished contact hitter in Twins history, he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player Award, setting a Twins record with a .388 batting average. Carew appeared in 18 consecutive All-Star Games and led the AL in hits three times, with his 239 hits in  ranking as the 12th most in a season at the time and the 16th most as of 2024, tied with Willie Keeler\u2019s 239 hits from . He won seven AL batting titles, the second most AL batting titles in history behind Ty Cobb, and on July 12, 2016, the AL batting title was renamed to the Rod Carew American League batting title.\n\nIn 1977, Carew was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs. On August 4, 1985, he became the 16th member of the 3,000 hit club with a single to left field off Frank Viola. His 3,053 hits are 27th all time, and his career batting average of .328 is 34th all time. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991 in his first year of eligibility; he appeared on upwards of 90 percent of the ballots. He was also elected to the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame, Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame, and Angels Hall of Fame. After retiring as a player, Carew served as a coach for the Angels and the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nEarly life\nCarew is the son of Olga Teoma, and Eric Carew Sr., a painter. Carew is a Zonian and was born to a Panamanian mother on a train in the town of Gat\u00fan, which, at that time, was in the Panama Canal Zone.Goldman, Rob pp. 145 The train was racially segregated; white passengers were given the better forward cars, while non-whites, like Carew's mother, were forced to ride in the rearward cars. Traveling on the train was Dr. Rodney Cline, who delivered the baby. In appreciation for this, Mrs. Carew named the boy Rodney Cline Carew. Carew later acknowledged in 2020 that he and his father Eric had a very tumultuous relationship, even stating \"Baseball was the one thing that kept me from killing my father.\" In his memoir One Tough Out, Carew stated that his father was a violent alcoholic who would often physically abuse him and his mother, and that Carew eventually came close to killing him with a machete.\n\nAt age 14, Carew and his siblings immigrated to the United States to join his mother in the Washington Heights section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City.Goldman, Rob pp. 147 Although Carew attended George Washington High School, he never played baseball for the high school team. According to Carew, his interest in baseball redeveloped at the age of 18; as when he was younger and still in Panama, his mother convinced him he could get away from his father if he played baseball. Carew later played semi-professional baseball for the Bronx Cavaliers,Goldman, Rob pp. 148 which is where he was discovered by Minnesota Twins scout Monroe Katz (whose son, Steve, played with Carew on the Cavaliers). Katz then recommended Carew to another Twins scout, Herb Stein, who arranged a tryout in April 1964,Goldman, Rob pp. 149 and Carew performed so well that manager Sam Mele finished the tryout early so that the Yankees would not see him. Herb Stein along with Katz signed Carew to an amateur free agent contract (at the Stella D'Oro Restaurant in the Bronx) on June 24, 1964 for a monthly salary of $400 ().\n\nStarting his minor league career, Carew was assigned to play second base with the Melbourne Twins in the Cocoa Rookie League and hit .325 over the final 37 games of the season. Over the next two years he would end up hitting .302 in Class A playing second base for the Wilson Tobs and the Orlando Twins.\n\nMajor league career\nMinnesota Twins\nIn the top of the second inning on April 11, 1967, at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles, Carew hit a single for his first major league hit in his first plate appearance, he would finish the game going 2\u20134. A few weeks later against the Washington Senators, Carew went 5\u20135 with a double and a stolen base for the first 5\u2013hit game of his career. He was elected to the first of his 18 consecutive All-Star game appearances, and won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year award receiving 19 of 20 first place votes. In a game against the Detroit Tigers at Metropolitan Stadium on May 18, 1969, Cesar Tovar led off the bottom of the third with a single. With Carew at bat, pitcher Mickey Lolich balked and Tovar moved to second base, then stole third. Carew walked, then executed a double steal with Tovar as Tovar stole home and Carew stole second. Carew then stole third base, followed by a steal of home. This marked the 41st time in Major League history and the 20th time in AL history that a runner had stolen every base in an inning. Carew stole home seven times in 1969, leading the major leagues in this category and just missing Ty Cobb's record of eight. Carew's seven steals of home in 1969 was the most in the majors since Pete Reiser stole seven for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. Manager Billy Martin had worked with Carew throughout the 1969 season to learn how to steal home,Goldman, Rob pp. 150 and teammate Sandy Valdespino had taught Carew how to bunt more effectively, at the end of the season he led the AL with a .332 batting average, the second-place finisher, Reggie Smith, had a .309 average.\n\nthumb|left|Carew with the Minnesota Twins warming up before a game in Cleveland in 1975\nCarew had hit for the cycle on May 20, 1970, against the Kansas City Royals, going 4\u20135 with a stolen base, this was the first cycle hit by a member of the Twins. Later that year, on June 22, he was injured at second base attempting to convert a double play, he had surgery to repair ligaments in his left leg, and missed 92 games. In 1972, Carew led the AL in batting, hitting .318; he had no home runs for the only time in his career. This was the first time since 1918, when Zack Wheat won the National League batting championship, that a player won the batting title with no home runs.\n\nThe start of the 1973 season was slow, Carew was only hitting .246 by the end of April. Carew performed well during the summer months, including a 5-hit performance on August 14. By the end of September he was back in the major league lead with a .353 average. When the season concluded he won his third batting title, with a major league leading .350 batting average. His 203 hits and 11 triples also led the AL. The next season, Carew had his best year to date, from his first at bat on April 5, against the Kansas City Royals, he never batted below .300 for the entire year. Through June 27, he was batting .400 but cooled off near the end of the season. His 213 hits were a career-high, and led the majors, and he collected his fourth career batting title with a .364 batting average.\n\nIn 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title. He joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. Seeing time predominantly at second base early in his career, Carew moved to first base in September 1975 and stayed there for the rest of his career. Carew missed out on winning another batting title in 1976 as his .331 average was only .002 behind the league leader George Brett. Carew still collected career highs in stolen bases, games played and triples, and had 200 hits for the third time in his career.\n\nIn the 1977 season, Carew batted .388, which was the highest since Boston's Ted Williams hit .388 in 1957; he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He also set career highs with 239 hits (at that time the most by any player since 1930), 100 RBIs and 128 runs scored. In the summer of 1977, Carew appeared on the cover of Time with the caption \"Baseball's Best Hitter\". He won his seventh and final batting title in 1978 when he hit .333. He had finished in the top 15 in AL MVP voting in every season between 1972 and 1978.\n\nCalifornia Angels\n\nthumb|upright|Carew with the Angels.\n\nIn 1979, allegedly frustrated by the Twins' inability to keep young talent, some racist comments by Calvin Griffith, and the Twins' overall penny-pinching negotiating style, Carew announced his intention to leave the Twins. On February 3, Carew was traded to the Angels for outfielder Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, right-handed pitcher Paul Hartzell, and left-handed pitcher Brad Havens. Although it would have represented an infusion of talent, the Twins were unable to complete a possibly better deal with the New York Yankees in January in which Carew would have moved to the Yankees in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Ben\u00edquez, D\u00e1maso Garc\u00eda, and Dave Righetti. In 2020, Carew denied the longtime allegations that the controversial comments which Griffith made in 1978 suggesting support for Minnesota having a low African-American population and the idea that blacks preferred wrestling to baseball was what triggered his trade to the Angels when he stated, \"When he traded me prior to the 1979 season, Calvin told me he wanted me to be paid what I was worth. Later that year the Angels made me the highest paid player in baseball. A racist wouldn't have done that.\"\n\nthumb|right|255px|Carew bats at Yankee Stadium in 1979.\n\nThough Carew did not win a batting title after 1978, he hit between .305 and .339 from 1979 to 1983. In 1982, Carew broke his hand early in the season. Newspaper reports characterized him as swinging one-handed that season due to pain, but he put together a 25-game hitting streak at one point in the season. He played in 138 games that year and hit .319. The Angels went to the playoffs in 1982, which was Carew's fourth and final appearance in postseason play. The team lost a five-game series (three games to two) to the Milwaukee Brewers. Carew played in all five games, but he hit .176 (three hits in 17 at-bats). Carew grounded out to end the fifth and final game by hitting a routine groundball to shortstop Robin Yount off a pitch from Pete Ladd, a minor-league journeyman who replaced the injured Brewers closer Rollie Fingers.\n\nOn August 4, 1985, Carew joined an elite group of ballplayers when he got his 3,000th base hit against Minnesota Twins left-hander Frank Viola at the former Anaheim Stadium. The 1985 season was his last. After the season, Rod Carew was granted free agency, after the Angels declined to offer him a new contract. He received an offer from the Boston Red Sox to be their minor league hitting instructor. His only offer to continue his playing career in 1986 was from the San Francisco Giants. He declined the offer and opted to retire. Carew suspected that baseball owners were colluding to keep him (and other players) from signing. On January 10, 1995, nearly a decade after his forced retirement, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that the owners had violated the rules of baseball's second collusion agreement. Carew was awarded damages equivalent to what he would have likely received in 1986: $782,035.71. Carew finished his career with 3,053 hits and a lifetime batting average of .328.\n\nThrough 2017, Carew still holds many places in the Twins record books, including: highest career batting average (.334), second-highest on-base percentage (.393, tied with Buddy Myer), fourth-highest in intentional walks (99), fifth in hits (2,085), and fifth in stolen bases (271). He also holds many spots in the Angels record books, including: highest career on-base percentage (.393), second-highest batting average (.314), and sixth-highest in both intentional walks (45) and sacrifice hits (60). Carew's career total of 17 steals of home ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.\n\nCareer statistics\nIn 2,469 games over 19 seasons, Carew posted a .328 batting average (3,053-for-9,315) with 1,424 runs, 445 doubles, 112 triples, 92 home runs, 1,015 RBI, 353 stolen bases, 1,018 bases on balls, .393 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage playing at first and second base. In 14 ALCS games, he hit .220 (11-for-50) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 1 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 5 walks.  He also had a batting average of .300 or higher in 15 consecutive seasons (1969-1983). Carew recorded 7 five-hit games and 51 four-hit games in his 19-year MLB career. Carew was also an effective pinch hitter in his career, recording a .315  batting average (40-for-127) with 3 home runs and 33 RBI in that role.\n\nOutside baseball\n\nMilitary service\nDuring the 1960s, Carew served a six-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a combat engineer. He later said that his military experience helped him in his baseball career. Carew said, \"When I joined the Marine Corps, it was a life-changing event for me because I learned about discipline. When I first came up to the big leagues in 1967, I was a little bit of a hothead. But after two weeks of war games every summer, I realized that baseball was not do-or-die. That kind of discipline made me the player I became.\"\n\nConfusion over conversion to Judaism\nThere is no evidence that Carew ever formally converted to Judaism, although he wore a chai necklace during his playing days. His first wife, Marilynn Levy, is Jewish, and he was a member of Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Ana, California. Their three daughters, Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle, were raised in the Jewish tradition and had their bat mitzvahs there. When one daughter, Michelle, died of leukemia at age 18, services were held at Beth Shalom,Reyes, David. \"Friends and Family Say Last Goodbye to Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. and she was buried in the family plot at the United Hebrew Brotherhood Cemetery in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, where Rod Carew played for the Minnesota Twins.Reyes, David. \"Hundreds of Minnesotans Attend Funeral for Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. Carew, however, still identified as Episcopalian during their relationship.\n\nA 2007 Salon article named Carew one of the 18 best Jewish ballplayers of all time; the article clarified that Carew was not Jewish but commended him for raising his children in the faith and for marrying Levy in spite of death threats he received. Carew and Levy, who began their relationship in 1968, were married in 1970 and divorced in 2000.\n\nAnother source propagating the story is \"The Chanukah Song\", written and performed by Adam Sandler in 1994. The tune (which quickly became a holiday perennial) lists famous Jews of the 20th century: \"...O. J. Simpson... not a Jew! But guess who is: Hall of Famer Rod Carew! He converted!\" Carew later wrote Sandler and explained the situation, adding that he thought the song was \"pretty funny\". (Sandler dropped Carew from later versions of the song, but Neil Diamond mentions the ballplayer in his rendition, recorded in 2009.)\n\nAfter retirement\n\nCarew moved to the community of Anaheim Hills, California, while playing with the Angels and remained there after his retirement. Carew was hired as the Angels' hitting coach on November 5, 1991, and served in a similar capacity with the Milwaukee Brewers. He is credited with helping develop young hitters like Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, and Tim Salmon. Carew has also worked at various times as a minor league and spring training hitting and base running coach for the Twins and serves as an international youth baseball instructor for Major League Baseball.\n\nCarew married his second wife Rhonda in December 2001; she has two children, Cheyenne and Devon. Devout Christians, the family attends Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California.\n\nOn January 19, 2004, Panama City's National Stadium was renamed \"Rod Carew Stadium\". In 2005, Carew was named the second baseman on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team.\n\nCarew's number 29 was retired by the Twins on July 19, 1987, and by the Angels in 1986. Carew was the fourth inductee into the Angels' Hall of Fame on August 6, 1991. Carew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility, the 22nd player so elected; he went into the Hall with a Twins cap. In 1999, he ranked #61 on The Sporting News''' list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. Carew was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nthumb|Carew (left) talks to a fan in May 2014.\nCarew has three biological children from his first marriage\u2014Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle. In September 1995, his youngest of three daughters, Michelle, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a relatively rare leukemia for a young person. Doctors wanted to perform a bone marrow transplant, but Michelle's rare ethnic heritage complicated the search for a matching donor; her father was black with West Indian and Panamanian roots and her mother was of Russian-Jewish ancestry. Carew pleaded for those of similar ethnic background to come forward. When no matching bone marrow donor was found, an umbilical cord blood transplant was performed in March 1996. Michelle died on April 17, 1996, at the age of 18. A statue of her has been installed in Angel Stadium of Anaheim.\n\nCarew began using chewing tobacco in 1964 and was a regular user up to 1992, when a cancerous growth in his mouth was discovered and removed. The years of use had severely damaged his teeth and gums, and Carew has spent a reported $100,000 in restorative dental work.\n\nIn September 2015, Carew suffered a massive heart attack while on a California golf course. He was hospitalized for more than six weeks, and had several surgical procedures, which culminated with implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Carew recovered sufficiently to take part in the Twins' 2016 spring training as an instructor, coach, and launch the Heart of 29 Campaign.Rod Carew's Return Further, Carew became involved in the branding and launching of a Left Ventricular Assist Device wear company, Carew Medical Wear. In February 2016, Carew indicated that his doctors informed him that he would eventually need a heart transplant. The transplant was done on December 15, 2016.Former Angels great Rod Carew reportedly set for heart transplant. Orange County Register. December 15, 2016. Retrieved December 15, 2016. Carew's transplanted heart was donated by former Baltimore Ravens tight end Konrad Reuland. Reuland had attended middle school with Carew's children and was inspired by Carew to become a professional athlete in elementary, after meeting him as a child. Reuland later became a high school athlete in baseball, as well as basketball and football. Carew participated in the 2018 Rose Parade aboard the Donate Life float on New Year's Day, in honor of Reuland.\n\nIn a pre-game ceremony before the 2016 MLB All Star Game in San Diego, the American League batting championship trophy was named the Rod Carew American League Batting Championship Award''.\n\nIn 2016, Rod Carew was awarded the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award.\n\nOn August 23, 2024, Carew became a citizen of the United States.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\n 3,000 hit club\n List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\n List of Major League Baseball batting champions\n List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders\n DHL Hometown Heroes\n Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nRetired Numbers: Rod Carew, Minnesota Twins at MLB.com\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1945 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American League All-Stars\nCategory:American League batting champions\nCategory:American League Most Valuable Player Award winners\nCategory:American sportspeople of Panamanian descent\nCategory:Panamanian people of African descent\nCategory:Anaheim Angels coaches\nCategory:California Angels coaches\nCategory:California Angels players\nCategory:Caribbean Series managers\nCategory:Cocoa Rookie League Twins\nCategory:George Washington Educational Campus alumni\nCategory:Heart transplant recipients\nCategory:Major League Baseball first basemen\nCategory:Major League Baseball hitting coaches\nCategory:Major League Baseball players from Panama\nCategory:Major League Baseball players with retired numbers\nCategory:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners\nCategory:Major League Baseball second basemen\nCategory:Milwaukee Brewers coaches\nCategory:Minnesota Twins players\nCategory:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees\nCategory:Orlando Twins players\nCategory:People from Anaheim Hills, California\nCategory:Baseball players from Orange County, California\nCategory:People from Col\u00f3n District\nCategory:People from Washington Heights, Manhattan\nCategory:Naturalized citizens of Panama\nCategory:Baseball players from Manhattan\nCategory:Tigres de Aragua players\nCategory:Panamanian expatriate baseball players in Venezuela\nCategory:United States Marine Corps reservists\nCategory:Wilson Tobs players\nCategory:American Anglicans\nCategory:Zonians\nCategory:Panamanian emigrants to the United States\nCategory:Melbourne Twins players",

Carew later acknowledged in 2020 that he and his father Eric had a very tumultuous relationship, even stating \"Baseball was the one thing that kept me from killing my father.\" In his memoir One Tough Out, Carew stated that his father was a violent alcoholic who would often physically abuse him and his mother, and that Carew eventually came close to killing him with a machete.\n\nAt age 14, Carew and his siblings immigrated to the United States to join his mother in the Washington Heights section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City.Goldman, Rob pp. 147 Although Carew attended George Washington High School, he never played baseball for the high school team. According to Carew, his interest in baseball redeveloped at the age of 18; as when he was younger and still in Panama, his mother convinced him he could get away from his father if he played baseball. Carew later played semi-professional baseball for the Bronx Cavaliers,Goldman, Rob pp. 148 which is where he was discovered by Minnesota Twins scout Monroe Katz (whose son, Steve, played with Carew on the Cavaliers). Katz then recommended Carew to another Twins scout, Herb Stein, who arranged a tryout in April 1964,Goldman, Rob pp. 149 and Carew performed so well that manager Sam Mele finished the tryout early so that the Yankees would not see him. Herb Stein along with Katz signed Carew to an amateur free agent contract (at the Stella D'Oro Restaurant in the Bronx) on June 24, 1964 for a monthly salary of $400 ().\n\nStarting his minor league career, Carew was assigned to play second base with the Melbourne Twins in the Cocoa Rookie League and hit .325 over the final 37 games of the season. Over the next two years he would end up hitting .302 in Class A playing second base for the Wilson Tobs and the Orlando Twins.\n\nMajor league career\nMinnesota Twins\nIn the top of the second inning on April 11, 1967, at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles, Carew hit a single for his first major league hit in his first plate appearance, he would finish the game going 2\u20134. A few weeks later against the Washington Senators, Carew went 5\u20135 with a double and a stolen base for the first 5\u2013hit game of his career. He was elected to the first of his 18 consecutive All-Star game appearances, and won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year award receiving 19 of 20 first place votes. In a game against the Detroit Tigers at Metropolitan Stadium on May 18, 1969, Cesar Tovar led off the bottom of the third with a single. With Carew at bat, pitcher Mickey Lolich balked and Tovar moved to second base, then stole third. Carew walked, then executed a double steal with Tovar as Tovar stole home and Carew stole second. Carew then stole third base, followed by a steal of home. This marked the 41st time in Major League history and the 20th time in AL history that a runner had stolen every base in an inning. Carew stole home seven times in 1969, leading the major leagues in this category and just missing Ty Cobb's record of eight. Carew's seven steals of home in 1969 was the most in the majors since Pete Reiser stole seven for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. Manager Billy Martin had worked with Carew throughout the 1969 season to learn how to steal home,Goldman, Rob pp. 150 and teammate Sandy Valdespino had taught Carew how to bunt more effectively, at the end of the season he led the AL with a .332 batting average, the second-place finisher, Reggie Smith, had a .309 average.\n\nthumb|left|Carew with the Minnesota Twins warming up before a game in Cleveland in 1975\nCarew had hit for the cycle on May 20, 1970, against the Kansas City Royals, going 4\u20135 with a stolen base, this was the first cycle hit by a member of the Twins. Later that year, on June 22, he was injured at second base attempting to convert a double play, he had surgery to repair ligaments in his left leg, and missed 92 games. In 1972, Carew led the AL in batting, hitting .318; he had no home runs for the only time in his career. This was the first time since 1918, when Zack Wheat won the National League batting championship, that a player won the batting title with no home runs.\n\nThe start of the 1973 season was slow, Carew was only hitting .246 by the end of April. Carew performed well during the summer months, including a 5-hit performance on August 14. By the end of September he was back in the major league lead with a .353 average. When the season concluded he won his third batting title, with a major league leading .350 batting average. His 203 hits and 11 triples also led the AL. The next season, Carew had his best year to date, from his first at bat on April 5, against the Kansas City Royals, he never batted below .300 for the entire year. Through June 27, he was batting .400 but cooled off near the end of the season. His 213 hits were a career-high, and led the majors, and he collected his fourth career batting title with a .364 batting average.\n\nIn 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title. He joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. Seeing time predominantly at second base early in his career, Carew moved to first base in September 1975 and stayed there for the rest of his career. Carew missed out on winning another batting title in 1976 as his .331 average was only .002 behind the league leader George Brett. Carew still collected career highs in stolen bases, games played and triples, and had 200 hits for the third time in his career.\n\nIn the 1977 season, Carew batted .388, which was the highest since Boston's Ted Williams hit .388 in 1957; he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He also set career highs with 239 hits (at that time the most by any player since 1930), 100 RBIs and 128 runs scored. In the summer of 1977, Carew appeared on the cover of Time with the caption \"Baseball's Best Hitter\". He won his seventh and final batting title in 1978 when he hit .333. He had finished in the top 15 in AL MVP voting in every season between 1972 and 1978.\n\nCalifornia Angels\n\nthumb|upright|Carew with the Angels.\n\nIn 1979, allegedly frustrated by the Twins' inability to keep young talent, some racist comments by Calvin Griffith, and the Twins' overall penny-pinching negotiating style, Carew announced his intention to leave the Twins. On February 3, Carew was traded to the Angels for outfielder Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, right-handed pitcher Paul Hartzell, and left-handed pitcher Brad Havens. Although it would have represented an infusion of talent, the Twins were unable to complete a possibly better deal with the New York Yankees in January in which Carew would have moved to the Yankees in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Ben\u00edquez, D\u00e1maso Garc\u00eda, and Dave Righetti. In 2020, Carew denied the longtime allegations that the controversial comments which Griffith made in 1978 suggesting support for Minnesota having a low African-American population and the idea that blacks preferred wrestling to baseball was what triggered his trade to the Angels when he stated, \"When he traded me prior to the 1979 season, Calvin told me he wanted me to be paid what I was worth. Later that year the Angels made me the highest paid player in baseball. A racist wouldn't have done that.\"\n\nthumb|right|255px|Carew bats at Yankee Stadium in 1979.\n\nThough Carew did not win a batting title after 1978, he hit between .305 and .339 from 1979 to 1983. In 1982, Carew broke his hand early in the season. Newspaper reports characterized him as swinging one-handed that season due to pain, but he put together a 25-game hitting streak at one point in the season. He played in 138 games that year and hit .319. The Angels went to the playoffs in 1982, which was Carew's fourth and final appearance in postseason play. The team lost a five-game series (three games to two) to the Milwaukee Brewers. Carew played in all five games, but he hit .176 (three hits in 17 at-bats). Carew grounded out to end the fifth and final game by hitting a routine groundball to shortstop Robin Yount off a pitch from Pete Ladd, a minor-league journeyman who replaced the injured Brewers closer Rollie Fingers.\n\nOn August 4, 1985, Carew joined an elite group of ballplayers when he got his 3,000th base hit against Minnesota Twins left-hander Frank Viola at the former Anaheim Stadium. The 1985 season was his last. After the season, Rod Carew was granted free agency, after the Angels declined to offer him a new contract. He received an offer from the Boston Red Sox to be their minor league hitting instructor. His only offer to continue his playing career in 1986 was from the San Francisco Giants. He declined the offer and opted to retire. Carew suspected that baseball owners were colluding to keep him (and other players) from signing. On January 10, 1995, nearly a decade after his forced retirement, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that the owners had violated the rules of baseball's second collusion agreement. Carew was awarded damages equivalent to what he would have likely received in 1986: $782,035.71. Carew finished his career with 3,053 hits and a lifetime batting average of .328.\n\nThrough 2017, Carew still holds many places in the Twins record books, including: highest career batting average (.334), second-highest on-base percentage (.393, tied with Buddy Myer), fourth-highest in intentional walks (99), fifth in hits (2,085), and fifth in stolen bases (271). He also holds many spots in the Angels record books, including: highest career on-base percentage (.393), second-highest batting average (.314), and sixth-highest in both intentional walks (45) and sacrifice hits (60). Carew's career total of 17 steals of home ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.\n\nCareer statistics\nIn 2,469 games over 19 seasons, Carew posted a .328 batting average (3,053-for-9,315) with 1,424 runs, 445 doubles, 112 triples, 92 home runs, 1,015 RBI, 353 stolen bases, 1,018 bases on balls, .393 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage playing at first and second base. In 14 ALCS games, he hit .220 (11-for-50) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 1 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 5 walks.  He also had a batting average of .300 or higher in 15 consecutive seasons (1969-1983). Carew recorded 7 five-hit games and 51 four-hit games in his 19-year MLB career. Carew was also an effective pinch hitter in his career, recording a .315  batting average (40-for-127) with 3 home runs and 33 RBI in that role.\n\nOutside baseball\n\nMilitary service\nDuring the 1960s, Carew served a six-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a combat engineer. He later said that his military experience helped him in his baseball career. Carew said, \"When I joined the Marine Corps, it was a life-changing event for me because I learned about discipline. When I first came up to the big leagues in 1967, I was a little bit of a hothead. But after two weeks of war games every summer, I realized that baseball was not do-or-die. That kind of discipline made me the player I became.\"\n\nConfusion over conversion to Judaism\nThere is no evidence that Carew ever formally converted to Judaism, although he wore a chai necklace during his playing days. His first wife, Marilynn Levy, is Jewish, and he was a member of Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Ana, California. Their three daughters, Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle, were raised in the Jewish tradition and had their bat mitzvahs there. When one daughter, Michelle, died of leukemia at age 18, services were held at Beth Shalom,Reyes, David. \"Friends and Family Say Last Goodbye to Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. and she was buried in the family plot at the United Hebrew Brotherhood Cemetery in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, where Rod Carew played for the Minnesota Twins.Reyes, David. \"Hundreds of Minnesotans Attend Funeral for Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. Carew, however, still identified as Episcopalian during their relationship.\n\nA 2007 Salon article named Carew one of the 18 best Jewish ballplayers of all time; the article clarified that Carew was not Jewish but commended him for raising his children in the faith and for marrying Levy in spite of death threats he received. Carew and Levy, who began their relationship in 1968, were married in 1970 and divorced in 2000.\n\nAnother source propagating the story is \"The Chanukah Song\", written and performed by Adam Sandler in 1994. The tune (which quickly became a holiday perennial) lists famous Jews of the 20th century: \"...O. J. Simpson... not a Jew! But guess who is: Hall of Famer Rod Carew! He converted!\" Carew later wrote Sandler and explained the situation, adding that he thought the song was \"pretty funny\". (Sandler dropped Carew from later versions of the song, but Neil Diamond mentions the ballplayer in his rendition, recorded in 2009.)\n\nAfter retirement\n\nCarew moved to the community of Anaheim Hills, California, while playing with the Angels and remained there after his retirement. Carew was hired as the Angels' hitting coach on November 5, 1991, and served in a similar capacity with the Milwaukee Brewers. He is credited with helping develop young hitters like Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, and Tim Salmon. Carew has also worked at various times as a minor league and spring training hitting and base running coach for the Twins and serves as an international youth baseball instructor for Major League Baseball.\n\nCarew married his second wife Rhonda in December 2001; she has two children, Cheyenne and Devon. Devout Christians, the family attends Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California.\n\nOn January 19, 2004, Panama City's National Stadium was renamed \"Rod Carew Stadium\". In 2005, Carew was named the second baseman on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team.\n\nCarew's number 29 was retired by the Twins on July 19, 1987, and by the Angels in 1986. Carew was the fourth inductee into the Angels' Hall of Fame on August 6, 1991. Carew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility, the 22nd player so elected; he went into the Hall with a Twins cap. In 1999, he ranked #61 on The Sporting News''' list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. Carew was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nthumb|Carew (left) talks to a fan in May 2014.\nCarew has three biological children from his first marriage\u2014Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle. In September 1995, his youngest of three daughters, Michelle, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a relatively rare leukemia for a young person. Doctors wanted to perform a bone marrow transplant, but Michelle's rare ethnic heritage complicated the search for a matching donor; her father was black with West Indian and Panamanian roots and her mother was of Russian-Jewish ancestry. Carew pleaded for those of similar ethnic background to come forward. When no matching bone marrow donor was found, an umbilical cord blood transplant was performed in March 1996. Michelle died on April 17, 1996, at the age of 18. A statue of her has been installed in Angel Stadium of Anaheim.\n\nCarew began using chewing tobacco in 1964 and was a regular user up to 1992, when a cancerous growth in his mouth was discovered and removed. The years of use had severely damaged his teeth and gums, and Carew has spent a reported $100,000 in restorative dental work.\n\nIn September 2015, Carew suffered a massive heart attack while on a California golf course. He was hospitalized for more than six weeks, and had several surgical procedures, which culminated with implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Carew recovered sufficiently to take part in the Twins' 2016 spring training as an instructor, coach, and launch the Heart of 29 Campaign.Rod Carew's Return Further, Carew became involved in the branding and launching of a Left Ventricular Assist Device wear company, Carew Medical Wear. In February 2016, Carew indicated that his doctors informed him that he would eventually need a heart transplant. The transplant was done on December 15, 2016.Former Angels great Rod Carew reportedly set for heart transplant. Orange County Register. December 15, 2016. Retrieved December 15, 2016. Carew's transplanted heart was donated by former Baltimore Ravens tight end Konrad Reuland. Reuland had attended middle school with Carew's children and was inspired by Carew to become a professional athlete in elementary, after meeting him as a child. Reuland later became a high school athlete in baseball, as well as basketball and football. Carew participated in the 2018 Rose Parade aboard the Donate Life float on New Year's Day, in honor of Reuland.\n\nIn a pre-game ceremony before the 2016 MLB All Star Game in San Diego, the American League batting championship trophy was named the Rod Carew American League Batting Championship Award''.\n\nIn 2016, Rod Carew was awarded the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award.\n\nOn August 23, 2024, Carew became a citizen of the United States.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\n 3,000 hit club\n List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\n List of Major League Baseball batting champions\n List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders\n DHL Hometown Heroes\n Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nRetired Numbers: Rod Carew, Minnesota Twins at MLB.com\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1945 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American League All-Stars\nCategory:American League batting champions\nCategory:American League Most Valuable Player Award winners\nCategory:American sportspeople of Panamanian descent\nCategory:Panamanian people of African descent\nCategory:Anaheim Angels coaches\nCategory:California Angels coaches\nCategory:California Angels players\nCategory:Caribbean Series managers\nCategory:Cocoa Rookie League Twins\nCategory:George Washington Educational Campus alumni\nCategory:Heart transplant recipients\nCategory:Major League Baseball first basemen\nCategory:Major League Baseball hitting coaches\nCategory:Major League Baseball players from Panama\nCategory:Major League Baseball players with retired numbers\nCategory:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners\nCategory:Major League Baseball second basemen\nCategory:Milwaukee Brewers coaches\nCategory:Minnesota Twins players\nCategory:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees\nCategory:Orlando Twins players\nCategory:People from Anaheim Hills, California\nCategory:Baseball players from Orange County, California\nCategory:People from Col\u00f3n District\nCategory:People from Washington Heights, Manhattan\nCategory:Naturalized citizens of Panama\nCategory:Baseball players from Manhattan\nCategory:Tigres de Aragua players\nCategory:Panamanian expatriate baseball players in Venezuela\nCategory:United States Marine Corps reservists\nCategory:Wilson Tobs players\nCategory:American Anglicans\nCategory:Zonians\nCategory:Panamanian emigrants to the United States\nCategory:Melbourne Twins players",

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman, first baseman and designated hitter from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins and the California Angels. The most accomplished contact hitter in Twins history, he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player Award, setting a Twins record with a .388 batting average. Carew appeared in 18 consecutive All-Star Games and led the AL in hits three times, with his 239 hits in  ranking as the 12th most in a season at the time and the 16th most as of 2024, tied with Willie Keeler\u2019s 239 hits from . He won seven AL batting titles, the second most AL batting titles in history behind Ty Cobb, and on July 12, 2016, the AL batting title was renamed to the Rod Carew American League batting title.\n\nIn 1977, Carew was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs. On August 4, 1985, he became the 16th member of the 3,000 hit club with a single to left field off Frank Viola. His 3,053 hits are 27th all time, and his career batting average of .328 is 34th all time. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991 in his first year of eligibility; he appeared on upwards of 90 percent of the ballots. He was also elected to the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame, Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame, and Angels Hall of Fame. After retiring as a player, Carew served as a coach for the Angels and the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nEarly life\nCarew is the son of Olga Teoma, and Eric Carew Sr., a painter. Carew is a Zonian and was born to a Panamanian mother on a train in the town of Gat\u00fan, which, at that time, was in the Panama Canal Zone.Goldman, Rob pp. 145 The train was racially segregated; white passengers were given the better forward cars, while non-whites, like Carew's mother, were forced to ride in the rearward cars.

Later that year the Angels made me the highest paid player in baseball. A racist wouldn't have done that.\"\n\nthumb|right|255px|Carew bats at Yankee Stadium in 1979.\n\nThough Carew did not win a batting title after 1978, he hit between .305 and .339 from 1979 to 1983. In 1982, Carew broke his hand early in the season. Newspaper reports characterized him as swinging one-handed that season due to pain, but he put together a 25-game hitting streak at one point in the season. He played in 138 games that year and hit .319. The Angels went to the playoffs in 1982, which was Carew's fourth and final appearance in postseason play. The team lost a five-game series (three games to two) to the Milwaukee Brewers. Carew played in all five games, but he hit .176 (three hits in 17 at-bats). Carew grounded out to end the fifth and final game by hitting a routine groundball to shortstop Robin Yount off a pitch from Pete Ladd, a minor-league journeyman who replaced the injured Brewers closer Rollie Fingers.\n\nOn August 4, 1985, Carew joined an elite group of ballplayers when he got his 3,000th base hit against Minnesota Twins left-hander Frank Viola at the former Anaheim Stadium. The 1985 season was his last. After the season, Rod Carew was granted free agency, after the Angels declined to offer him a new contract. He received an offer from the Boston Red Sox to be their minor league hitting instructor. His only offer to continue his playing career in 1986 was from the San Francisco Giants. He declined the offer and opted to retire. Carew suspected that baseball owners were colluding to keep him (and other players) from signing. On January 10, 1995, nearly a decade after his forced retirement, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that the owners had violated the rules of baseball's second collusion agreement. Carew was awarded damages equivalent to what he would have likely received in 1986: $782,035.71. Carew finished his career with 3,053 hits and a lifetime batting average of .328.\n\nThrough 2017, Carew still holds many places in the Twins record books, including: highest career batting average (.334), second-highest on-base percentage (.393, tied with Buddy Myer), fourth-highest in intentional walks (99), fifth in hits (2,085), and fifth in stolen bases (271). He also holds many spots in the Angels record books, including: highest career on-base percentage (.393), second-highest batting average (.314), and sixth-highest in both intentional walks (45) and sacrifice hits (60). Carew's career total of 17 steals of home ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.\n\nCareer statistics\nIn 2,469 games over 19 seasons, Carew posted a .328 batting average (3,053-for-9,315) with 1,424 runs, 445 doubles, 112 triples, 92 home runs, 1,015 RBI, 353 stolen bases, 1,018 bases on balls, .393 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage playing at first and second base. In 14 ALCS games, he hit .220 (11-for-50) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 1 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 5 walks.  He also had a batting average of .300 or higher in 15 consecutive seasons (1969-1983). Carew recorded 7 five-hit games and 51 four-hit games in his 19-year MLB career. Carew was also an effective pinch hitter in his career, recording a .315  batting average (40-for-127) with 3 home runs and 33 RBI in that role.\n\nOutside baseball\n\nMilitary service\nDuring the 1960s, Carew served a six-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a combat engineer. He later said that his military experience helped him in his baseball career. Carew said, \"When I joined the Marine Corps, it was a life-changing event for me because I learned about discipline. When I first came up to the big leagues in 1967, I was a little bit of a hothead. But after two weeks of war games every summer, I realized that baseball was not do-or-die. That kind of discipline made me the player I became.\"\n\nConfusion over conversion to Judaism\nThere is no evidence that Carew ever formally converted to Judaism, although he wore a chai necklace during his playing days. His first wife, Marilynn Levy, is Jewish, and he was a member of Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Ana, California. Their three daughters, Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle, were raised in the Jewish tradition and had their bat mitzvahs there. When one daughter, Michelle, died of leukemia at age 18, services were held at Beth Shalom,Reyes, David. \"Friends and Family Say Last Goodbye to Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times.

Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. Carew, however, still identified as Episcopalian during their relationship.\n\nA 2007 Salon article named Carew one of the 18 best Jewish ballplayers of all time; the article clarified that Carew was not Jewish but commended him for raising his children in the faith and for marrying Levy in spite of death threats he received. Carew and Levy, who began their relationship in 1968, were married in 1970 and divorced in 2000.\n\nAnother source propagating the story is \"The Chanukah Song\", written and performed by Adam Sandler in 1994. The tune (which quickly became a holiday perennial) lists famous Jews of the 20th century: \"...O. J. Simpson... not a Jew! But guess who is: Hall of Famer Rod Carew! He converted!\" Carew later wrote Sandler and explained the situation, adding that he thought the song was \"pretty funny\". (Sandler dropped Carew from later versions of the song, but Neil Diamond mentions the ballplayer in his rendition, recorded in 2009.)\n\nAfter retirement\n\nCarew moved to the community of Anaheim Hills, California, while playing with the Angels and remained there after his retirement. Carew was hired as the Angels' hitting coach on November 5, 1991, and served in a similar capacity with the Milwaukee Brewers. He is credited with helping develop young hitters like Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, and Tim Salmon. Carew has also worked at various times as a minor league and spring training hitting and base running coach for the Twins and serves as an international youth baseball instructor for Major League Baseball.\n\nCarew married his second wife Rhonda in December 2001; she has two children, Cheyenne and Devon. Devout Christians, the family attends Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California.\n\nOn January 19, 2004, Panama City's National Stadium was renamed \"Rod Carew Stadium\". In 2005, Carew was named the second baseman on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team.\n\nCarew's number 29 was retired by the Twins on July 19, 1987, and by the Angels in 1986. Carew was the fourth inductee into the Angels' Hall of Fame on August 6, 1991. Carew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility, the 22nd player so elected; he went into the Hall with a Twins cap. In 1999, he ranked #61 on The Sporting News''' list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. Carew was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nthumb|Carew (left) talks to a fan in May 2014.\nCarew has three biological children from his first marriage\u2014Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle. In September 1995, his youngest of three daughters, Michelle, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a relatively rare leukemia for a young person. Doctors wanted to perform a bone marrow transplant, but Michelle's rare ethnic heritage complicated the search for a matching donor; her father was black with West Indian and Panamanian roots and her mother was of Russian-Jewish ancestry. Carew pleaded for those of similar ethnic background to come forward. When no matching bone marrow donor was found, an umbilical cord blood transplant was performed in March 1996. Michelle died on April 17, 1996, at the age of 18. A statue of her has been installed in Angel Stadium of Anaheim.\n\nCarew began using chewing tobacco in 1964 and was a regular user up to 1992, when a cancerous growth in his mouth was discovered and removed. The years of use had severely damaged his teeth and gums, and Carew has spent a reported $100,000 in restorative dental work.\n\nIn September 2015, Carew suffered a massive heart attack while on a California golf course. He was hospitalized for more than six weeks, and had several surgical procedures, which culminated with implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Carew recovered sufficiently to take part in the Twins' 2016 spring training as an instructor, coach, and launch the Heart of 29 Campaign.Rod Carew's Return Further, Carew became involved in the branding and launching of a Left Ventricular Assist Device wear company, Carew Medical Wear. In February 2016, Carew indicated that his doctors informed him that he would eventually need a heart transplant. The transplant was done on December 15, 2016.Former Angels great Rod Carew reportedly set for heart transplant. Orange County Register. December 15, 2016. Retrieved December 15, 2016. Carew's transplanted heart was donated by former Baltimore Ravens tight end Konrad Reuland. Reuland had attended middle school with Carew's children and was inspired by Carew to become a professional athlete in elementary, after meeting him as a child. Reuland later became a high school athlete in baseball, as well as basketball and football. Carew participated in the 2018 Rose Parade aboard the Donate Life float on New Year's Day, in honor of Reuland.\n\nIn a pre-game ceremony before the 2016 MLB All Star Game in San Diego, the American League batting championship trophy was named the Rod Carew American League Batting Championship Award''.\n\nIn 2016, Rod Carew was awarded the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award.\n\nOn August 23, 2024, Carew became a citizen of the United States.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders\n List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\n 3,000 hit club\n List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\n List of Major League Baseball batting champions\n List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders\n List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders\n DHL Hometown Heroes\n Hispanics in the United States Marine Corps\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nRetired Numbers: Rod Carew, Minnesota Twins at MLB.com\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1945 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American League All-Stars\nCategory:American League batting champions\nCategory:American League Most Valuable Player Award winners\nCategory:American sportspeople of Panamanian descent\nCategory:Panamanian people of African descent\nCategory:Anaheim Angels coaches\nCategory:California Angels coaches\nCategory:California Angels players\nCategory:Caribbean Series managers\nCategory:Cocoa Rookie League Twins\nCategory:George Washington Educational Campus alumni\nCategory:Heart transplant recipients\nCategory:Major League Baseball first basemen\nCategory:Major League Baseball hitting coaches\nCategory:Major League Baseball players from Panama\nCategory:Major League Baseball players with retired numbers\nCategory:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners\nCategory:Major League Baseball second basemen\nCategory:Milwaukee Brewers coaches\nCategory:Minnesota Twins players\nCategory:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees\nCategory:Orlando Twins players\nCategory:People from Anaheim Hills, California\nCategory:Baseball players from Orange County, California\nCategory:People from Col\u00f3n District\nCategory:People from Washington Heights, Manhattan\nCategory:Naturalized citizens of Panama\nCategory:Baseball players from Manhattan\nCategory:Tigres de Aragua players\nCategory:Panamanian expatriate baseball players in Venezuela\nCategory:United States Marine Corps reservists\nCategory:Wilson Tobs players\nCategory:American Anglicans\nCategory:Zonians\nCategory:Panamanian emigrants to the United States\nCategory:Melbourne Twins players",

        "text": "Rodney Cline Carew (born October 1, 1945) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman, first baseman and designated hitter from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins and the California Angels. The most accomplished contact hitter in Twins history, he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player Award, setting a Twins record with a .388 batting average. Carew appeared in 18 consecutive All-Star Games and led the AL in hits three times, with his 239 hits in  ranking as the 12th most in a season at the time and the 16th most as of 2024, tied with Willie Keeler\u2019s 239 hits from . He won seven AL batting titles, the second most AL batting titles in history behind Ty Cobb, and on July 12, 2016, the AL batting title was renamed to the Rod Carew American League batting title.\n\nIn 1977, Carew was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs. On August 4, 1985, he became the 16th member of the 3,000 hit club with a single to left field off Frank Viola. His 3,053 hits are 27th all time, and his career batting average of .328 is 34th all time. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991 in his first year of eligibility; he appeared on upwards of 90 percent of the ballots. He was also elected to the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame, Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame, and Angels Hall of Fame. After retiring as a player, Carew served as a coach for the Angels and the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nEarly life\nCarew is the son of Olga Teoma, and Eric Carew Sr., a painter. Carew is a Zonian and was born to a Panamanian mother on a train in the town of Gat\u00fan, which, at that time, was in the Panama Canal Zone.Goldman, Rob pp. 145 The train was racially segregated; white passengers were given the better forward cars, while non-whites, like Carew's mother, were forced to ride in the rearward cars. Traveling on the train was Dr. Rodney Cline, who delivered the baby. In appreciation for this, Mrs. Carew named the boy Rodney Cline Carew. Carew later acknowledged in 2020 that he and his father Eric had a very tumultuous relationship, even stating \"Baseball was the one thing that kept me from killing my father.\" In his memoir One Tough Out, Carew stated that his father was a violent alcoholic who would often physically abuse him and his mother, and that Carew eventually came close to killing him with a machete.\n\nAt age 14, Carew and his siblings immigrated to the United States to join his mother in the Washington Heights section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City.Goldman, Rob pp. 147 Although Carew attended George Washington High School, he never played baseball for the high school team. According to Carew, his interest in baseball redeveloped at the age of 18; as when he was younger and still in Panama, his mother convinced him he could get away from his father if he played baseball. Carew later played semi-professional baseball for the Bronx Cavaliers,Goldman, Rob pp. 148 which is where he was discovered by Minnesota Twins scout Monroe Katz (whose son, Steve, played with Carew on the Cavaliers). Katz then recommended Carew to another Twins scout, Herb Stein, who arranged a tryout in April 1964,Goldman, Rob pp. 149 and Carew performed so well that manager Sam Mele finished the tryout early so that the Yankees would not see him. Herb Stein along with Katz signed Carew to an amateur free agent contract (at the Stella D'Oro Restaurant in the Bronx) on June 24, 1964 for a monthly salary of $400 ().\n\nStarting his minor league career, Carew was assigned to play second base with the Melbourne Twins in the Cocoa Rookie League and hit .325 over the final 37 games of the season. Over the next two years he would end up hitting .302 in Class A playing second base for the Wilson Tobs and the Orlando Twins.\n\nMajor league career\nMinnesota Twins\nIn the top of the second inning on April 11, 1967, at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles, Carew hit a single for his first major league hit in his first plate appearance, he would finish the game going 2\u20134. A few weeks later against the Washington Senators, Carew went 5\u20135 with a double and a stolen base for the first 5\u2013hit game of his career. He was elected to the first of his 18 consecutive All-Star game appearances, and won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year award receiving 19 of 20 first place votes. In a game against the Detroit Tigers at Metropolitan Stadium on May 18, 1969, Cesar Tovar led off the bottom of the third with a single. With Carew at bat, pitcher Mickey Lolich balked and Tovar moved to second base, then stole third. Carew walked, then executed a double steal with Tovar as Tovar stole home and Carew stole second. Carew then stole third base, followed by a steal of home. This marked the 41st time in Major League history and the 20th time in AL history that a runner had stolen every base in an inning. Carew stole home seven times in 1969, leading the major leagues in this category and just missing Ty Cobb's record of eight. Carew's seven steals of home in 1969 was the most in the majors since Pete Reiser stole seven for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. Manager Billy Martin had worked with Carew throughout the 1969 season to learn how to steal home,Goldman, Rob pp. 150 and teammate Sandy Valdespino had taught Carew how to bunt more effectively, at the end of the season he led the AL with a .332 batting average, the second-place finisher, Reggie Smith, had a .309 average.\n\nthumb|left|Carew with the Minnesota Twins warming up before a game in Cleveland in 1975\nCarew had hit for the cycle on May 20, 1970, against the Kansas City Royals, going 4\u20135 with a stolen base, this was the first cycle hit by a member of the Twins. Later that year, on June 22, he was injured at second base attempting to convert a double play, he had surgery to repair ligaments in his left leg, and missed 92 games. In 1972, Carew led the AL in batting, hitting .318; he had no home runs for the only time in his career. This was the first time since 1918, when Zack Wheat won the National League batting championship, that a player won the batting title with no home runs.\n\nThe start of the 1973 season was slow, Carew was only hitting .246 by the end of April. Carew performed well during the summer months, including a 5-hit performance on August 14. By the end of September he was back in the major league lead with a .353 average. When the season concluded he won his third batting title, with a major league leading .350 batting average. His 203 hits and 11 triples also led the AL. The next season, Carew had his best year to date, from his first at bat on April 5, against the Kansas City Royals, he never batted below .300 for the entire year. Through June 27, he was batting .400 but cooled off near the end of the season. His 213 hits were a career-high, and led the majors, and he collected his fourth career batting title with a .364 batting average.\n\nIn 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title. He joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. Seeing time predominantly at second base early in his career, Carew moved to first base in September 1975 and stayed there for the rest of his career. Carew missed out on winning another batting title in 1976 as his .331 average was only .002 behind the league leader George Brett. Carew still collected career highs in stolen bases, games played and triples, and had 200 hits for the third time in his career.\n\nIn the 1977 season, Carew batted .388, which was the highest since Boston's Ted Williams hit .388 in 1957; he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He also set career highs with 239 hits (at that time the most by any player since 1930), 100 RBIs and 128 runs scored. In the summer of 1977, Carew appeared on the cover of Time with the caption \"Baseball's Best Hitter\". He won his seventh and final batting title in 1978 when he hit .333. He had finished in the top 15 in AL MVP voting in every season between 1972 and 1978.\n\nCalifornia Angels\n\nthumb|upright|Carew with the Angels.\n\nIn 1979, allegedly frustrated by the Twins' inability to keep young talent, some racist comments by Calvin Griffith, and the Twins' overall penny-pinching negotiating style, Carew announced his intention to leave the Twins. On February 3, Carew was traded to the Angels for outfielder Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, right-handed pitcher Paul Hartzell, and left-handed pitcher Brad Havens. Although it would have represented an infusion of talent, the Twins were unable to complete a possibly better deal with the New York Yankees in January in which Carew would have moved to the Yankees in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Ben\u00edquez, D\u00e1maso Garc\u00eda, and Dave Righetti. In 2020, Carew denied the longtime allegations that the controversial comments which Griffith made in 1978 suggesting support for Minnesota having a low African-American population and the idea that blacks preferred wrestling to baseball was what triggered his trade to the Angels when he stated, \"When he traded me prior to the 1979 season, Calvin told me he wanted me to be paid what I was worth.

Carew's career total of 17 steals of home ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.\n\nCareer statistics\nIn 2,469 games over 19 seasons, Carew posted a .328 batting average (3,053-for-9,315) with 1,424 runs, 445 doubles, 112 triples, 92 home runs, 1,015 RBI, 353 stolen bases, 1,018 bases on balls, .393 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage.

        "text": "Rodney Cline Carew (born October 1, 1945) is a Panamanian-American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman, first baseman and designated hitter from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins and the California Angels. The most accomplished contact hitter in Twins history, he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player Award, setting a Twins record with a .388 batting average. Carew appeared in 18 consecutive All-Star Games and led the AL in hits three times, with his 239 hits in  ranking as the 12th most in a season at the time and the 16th most as of 2024, tied with Willie Keeler\u2019s 239 hits from . He won seven AL batting titles, the second most AL batting titles in history behind Ty Cobb, and on July 12, 2016, the AL batting title was renamed to the Rod Carew American League batting title.\n\nIn 1977, Carew was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs. On August 4, 1985, he became the 16th member of the 3,000 hit club with a single to left field off Frank Viola. His 3,053 hits are 27th all time, and his career batting average of .328 is 34th all time. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991 in his first year of eligibility; he appeared on upwards of 90 percent of the ballots. He was also elected to the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame, Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame, and Angels Hall of Fame. After retiring as a player, Carew served as a coach for the Angels and the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nEarly life\nCarew is the son of Olga Teoma, and Eric Carew Sr., a painter. Carew is a Zonian and was born to a Panamanian mother on a train in the town of Gat\u00fan, which, at that time, was in the Panama Canal Zone.Goldman, Rob pp. 145 The train was racially segregated; white passengers were given the better forward cars, while non-whites, like Carew's mother, were forced to ride in the rearward cars. Traveling on the train was Dr. Rodney Cline, who delivered the baby. In appreciation for this, Mrs. Carew named the boy Rodney Cline Carew. Carew later acknowledged in 2020 that he and his father Eric had a very tumultuous relationship, even stating \"Baseball was the one thing that kept me from killing my father.\" In his memoir One Tough Out, Carew stated that his father was a violent alcoholic who would often physically abuse him and his mother, and that Carew eventually came close to killing him with a machete.\n\nAt age 14, Carew and his siblings immigrated to the United States to join his mother in the Washington Heights section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City.Goldman, Rob pp. 147 Although Carew attended George Washington High School, he never played baseball for the high school team. According to Carew, his interest in baseball redeveloped at the age of 18; as when he was younger and still in Panama, his mother convinced him he could get away from his father if he played baseball. Carew later played semi-professional baseball for the Bronx Cavaliers,Goldman, Rob pp. 148 which is where he was discovered by Minnesota Twins scout Monroe Katz (whose son, Steve, played with Carew on the Cavaliers). Katz then recommended Carew to another Twins scout, Herb Stein, who arranged a tryout in April 1964,Goldman, Rob pp. 149 and Carew performed so well that manager Sam Mele finished the tryout early so that the Yankees would not see him. Herb Stein along with Katz signed Carew to an amateur free agent contract (at the Stella D'Oro Restaurant in the Bronx) on June 24, 1964 for a monthly salary of $400 ().\n\nStarting his minor league career, Carew was assigned to play second base with the Melbourne Twins in the Cocoa Rookie League and hit .325 over the final 37 games of the season. Over the next two years he would end up hitting .302 in Class A playing second base for the Wilson Tobs and the Orlando Twins.\n\nMajor league career\nMinnesota Twins\nIn the top of the second inning on April 11, 1967, at Memorial Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles, Carew hit a single for his first major league hit in his first plate appearance, he would finish the game going 2\u20134. A few weeks later against the Washington Senators, Carew went 5\u20135 with a double and a stolen base for the first 5\u2013hit game of his career. He was elected to the first of his 18 consecutive All-Star game appearances, and won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year award receiving 19 of 20 first place votes. In a game against the Detroit Tigers at Metropolitan Stadium on May 18, 1969, Cesar Tovar led off the bottom of the third with a single. With Carew at bat, pitcher Mickey Lolich balked and Tovar moved to second base, then stole third. Carew walked, then executed a double steal with Tovar as Tovar stole home and Carew stole second. Carew then stole third base, followed by a steal of home. This marked the 41st time in Major League history and the 20th time in AL history that a runner had stolen every base in an inning. Carew stole home seven times in 1969, leading the major leagues in this category and just missing Ty Cobb's record of eight. Carew's seven steals of home in 1969 was the most in the majors since Pete Reiser stole seven for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. Manager Billy Martin had worked with Carew throughout the 1969 season to learn how to steal home,Goldman, Rob pp. 150 and teammate Sandy Valdespino had taught Carew how to bunt more effectively, at the end of the season he led the AL with a .332 batting average, the second-place finisher, Reggie Smith, had a .309 average.\n\nthumb|left|Carew with the Minnesota Twins warming up before a game in Cleveland in 1975\nCarew had hit for the cycle on May 20, 1970, against the Kansas City Royals, going 4\u20135 with a stolen base, this was the first cycle hit by a member of the Twins. Later that year, on June 22, he was injured at second base attempting to convert a double play, he had surgery to repair ligaments in his left leg, and missed 92 games. In 1972, Carew led the AL in batting, hitting .318; he had no home runs for the only time in his career. This was the first time since 1918, when Zack Wheat won the National League batting championship, that a player won the batting title with no home runs.\n\nThe start of the 1973 season was slow, Carew was only hitting .246 by the end of April. Carew performed well during the summer months, including a 5-hit performance on August 14. By the end of September he was back in the major league lead with a .353 average. When the season concluded he won his third batting title, with a major league leading .350 batting average. His 203 hits and 11 triples also led the AL. The next season, Carew had his best year to date, from his first at bat on April 5, against the Kansas City Royals, he never batted below .300 for the entire year. Through June 27, he was batting .400 but cooled off near the end of the season. His 213 hits were a career-high, and led the majors, and he collected his fourth career batting title with a .364 batting average.\n\nIn 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title. He joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. Seeing time predominantly at second base early in his career, Carew moved to first base in September 1975 and stayed there for the rest of his career. Carew missed out on winning another batting title in 1976 as his .331 average was only .002 behind the league leader George Brett. Carew still collected career highs in stolen bases, games played and triples, and had 200 hits for the third time in his career.\n\nIn the 1977 season, Carew batted .388, which was the highest since Boston's Ted Williams hit .388 in 1957; he won the 1977 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He also set career highs with 239 hits (at that time the most by any player since 1930), 100 RBIs and 128 runs scored. In the summer of 1977, Carew appeared on the cover of Time with the caption \"Baseball's Best Hitter\". He won his seventh and final batting title in 1978 when he hit .333. He had finished in the top 15 in AL MVP voting in every season between 1972 and 1978.\n\nCalifornia Angels\n\nthumb|upright|Carew with the Angels.\n\nIn 1979, allegedly frustrated by the Twins' inability to keep young talent, some racist comments by Calvin Griffith, and the Twins' overall penny-pinching negotiating style, Carew announced his intention to leave the Twins. On February 3, Carew was traded to the Angels for outfielder Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, right-handed pitcher Paul Hartzell, and left-handed pitcher Brad Havens. Although it would have represented an infusion of talent, the Twins were unable to complete a possibly better deal with the New York Yankees in January in which Carew would have moved to the Yankees in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Ben\u00edquez, D\u00e1maso Garc\u00eda, and Dave Righetti. In 2020, Carew denied the longtime allegations that the controversial comments which Griffith made in 1978 suggesting support for Minnesota having a low African-American population and the idea that blacks preferred wrestling to baseball was what triggered his trade to the Angels when he stated, \"When he traded me prior to the 1979 season, Calvin told me he wanted me to be paid what I was worth. Later that year the Angels made me the highest paid player in baseball. A racist wouldn't have done that.\"\n\nthumb|right|255px|Carew bats at Yankee Stadium in 1979.\n\nThough Carew did not win a batting title after 1978, he hit between .305 and .339 from 1979 to 1983. In 1982, Carew broke his hand early in the season. Newspaper reports characterized him as swinging one-handed that season due to pain, but he put together a 25-game hitting streak at one point in the season. He played in 138 games that year and hit .319. The Angels went to the playoffs in 1982, which was Carew's fourth and final appearance in postseason play. The team lost a five-game series (three games to two) to the Milwaukee Brewers. Carew played in all five games, but he hit .176 (three hits in 17 at-bats). Carew grounded out to end the fifth and final game by hitting a routine groundball to shortstop Robin Yount off a pitch from Pete Ladd, a minor-league journeyman who replaced the injured Brewers closer Rollie Fingers.\n\nOn August 4, 1985, Carew joined an elite group of ballplayers when he got his 3,000th base hit against Minnesota Twins left-hander Frank Viola at the former Anaheim Stadium. The 1985 season was his last. After the season, Rod Carew was granted free agency, after the Angels declined to offer him a new contract. He received an offer from the Boston Red Sox to be their minor league hitting instructor. His only offer to continue his playing career in 1986 was from the San Francisco Giants. He declined the offer and opted to retire. Carew suspected that baseball owners were colluding to keep him (and other players) from signing. On January 10, 1995, nearly a decade after his forced retirement, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that the owners had violated the rules of baseball's second collusion agreement. Carew was awarded damages equivalent to what he would have likely received in 1986: $782,035.71. Carew finished his career with 3,053 hits and a lifetime batting average of .328.\n\nThrough 2017, Carew still holds many places in the Twins record books, including: highest career batting average (.334), second-highest on-base percentage (.393, tied with Buddy Myer), fourth-highest in intentional walks (99), fifth in hits (2,085), and fifth in stolen bases (271). He also holds many spots in the Angels record books, including: highest career on-base percentage (.393), second-highest batting average (.314), and sixth-highest in both intentional walks (45) and sacrifice hits (60). Carew's career total of 17 steals of home ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.\n\nCareer statistics\nIn 2,469 games over 19 seasons, Carew posted a .328 batting average (3,053-for-9,315) with 1,424 runs, 445 doubles, 112 triples, 92 home runs, 1,015 RBI, 353 stolen bases, 1,018 bases on balls, .393 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage playing at first and second base. In 14 ALCS games, he hit .220 (11-for-50) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 1 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 5 walks.  He also had a batting average of .300 or higher in 15 consecutive seasons (1969-1983). Carew recorded 7 five-hit games and 51 four-hit games in his 19-year MLB career. Carew was also an effective pinch hitter in his career, recording a .315  batting average (40-for-127) with 3 home runs and 33 RBI in that role.\n\nOutside baseball\n\nMilitary service\nDuring the 1960s, Carew served a six-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a combat engineer. He later said that his military experience helped him in his baseball career. Carew said, \"When I joined the Marine Corps, it was a life-changing event for me because I learned about discipline. When I first came up to the big leagues in 1967, I was a little bit of a hothead. But after two weeks of war games every summer, I realized that baseball was not do-or-die. That kind of discipline made me the player I became.\"\n\nConfusion over conversion to Judaism\nThere is no evidence that Carew ever formally converted to Judaism, although he wore a chai necklace during his playing days. His first wife, Marilynn Levy, is Jewish, and he was a member of Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Ana, California. Their three daughters, Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle, were raised in the Jewish tradition and had their bat mitzvahs there. When one daughter, Michelle, died of leukemia at age 18, services were held at Beth Shalom,Reyes, David. \"Friends and Family Say Last Goodbye to Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. and she was buried in the family plot at the United Hebrew Brotherhood Cemetery in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, where Rod Carew played for the Minnesota Twins.Reyes, David. \"Hundreds of Minnesotans Attend Funeral for Michelle Carew\". Los Angeles Times. April 20, 1996. Carew, however, still identified as Episcopalian during their relationship.\n\nA 2007 Salon article named Carew one of the 18 best Jewish ballplayers of all time; the article clarified that Carew was not Jewish but commended him for raising his children in the faith and for marrying Levy in spite of death threats he received. Carew and Levy, who began their relationship in 1968, were married in 1970 and divorced in 2000.\n\nAnother source propagating the story is \"The Chanukah Song\", written and performed by Adam Sandler in 1994. The tune (which quickly became a holiday perennial) lists famous Jews of the 20th century: \"...O. J. Simpson... not a Jew! But guess who is: Hall of Famer Rod Carew! He converted!\" Carew later wrote Sandler and explained the situation, adding that he thought the song was \"pretty funny\". (Sandler dropped Carew from later versions of the song, but Neil Diamond mentions the ballplayer in his rendition, recorded in 2009.)\n\nAfter retirement\n\nCarew moved to the community of Anaheim Hills, California, while playing with the Angels and remained there after his retirement. Carew was hired as the Angels' hitting coach on November 5, 1991, and served in a similar capacity with the Milwaukee Brewers. He is credited with helping develop young hitters like Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, and Tim Salmon. Carew has also worked at various times as a minor league and spring training hitting and base running coach for the Twins and serves as an international youth baseball instructor for Major League Baseball.\n\nCarew married his second wife Rhonda in December 2001; she has two children, Cheyenne and Devon. Devout Christians, the family attends Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California.\n\nOn January 19, 2004, Panama City's National Stadium was renamed \"Rod Carew Stadium\". In 2005, Carew was named the second baseman on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team.\n\nCarew's number 29 was retired by the Twins on July 19, 1987, and by the Angels in 1986. Carew was the fourth inductee into the Angels' Hall of Fame on August 6, 1991. Carew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility, the 22nd player so elected; he went into the Hall with a Twins cap.

        "text": "Svetlana Broz (born 7 July 1955) is a Bosnian author and physician who specializes in cardiology. She is the granddaughter of the Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito.\n\nEarly and personal life\nSvetlana Broz was born 7 July 1955 in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, the youngest child of  (1924\u20131995),Tito in Bjelovar by Stanislava Koprivica-O\u0161tri\u0107, a joint issue of the Coordinative Committee for Cherishing Revolutionary Traditions in Bjelovar and the Institute for the History of Workers Movement of Croatia, Zagreb, 1978, page 76. Josip Broz Tito's eldest son, and\nZlata Jelinek-Broz from Tuzla. As a teenager, Broz worked as a free-lance journalist from 1970 to 1975; many of her articles and interviews were published in newspapers and magazines.\n\nShe graduated from the Belgrade Medical School in 1980 and has served as a cardiologist at the Military Medical Academy from 1981 to 1999, and volunteered her services at the outbreak of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. Her new project is about inter-ethnic marriages entered into during the war. At the outbreak of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 she volunteered to work as a cardiologist in the atrocity zones. Over and over again her patients told her how their survival had been possible only thanks to individuals with the courage to stand up against the ethnic violence perpetrated by members of their own ethnic group, and in January 1993 she began interviewing for the book that describes these human experiences during the Bosnian War. The book was published in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1999 with a title Dobri ljudi u vremenu zla and in 2003 in the United States under the title Good People in an Evil Time.\n\nIn 2000, she moved to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina permanently. The reason for this was, as she stated in a 2005 interview for Bosnian daily newspaper Nezavisne novine: \"After the NATO intervention, I moved to Sarajevo. Twenty years ago, Belgrade was a European metropolis, a city that I loved a lot. Unfortunately, in a way that city has lost its soul. Sarajevo, despite going through a four-year-long siege of hell, kept its soul intact. I love Bosnia-Herzegovina, I feel as this is my homeland. Last year I even became a citizen.\"\n\nCareer\nBroz is currently heading the local branch of the Gardens of the Righteous Worldwide (GARIWO) non-governmental organization. She is the founder of \"Education Towards Civil Courage\", a series of seminars designed to teach adolescents from all over the Balkans how to stand up to corruption and social and political divisiveness. In 2007, the organization began research and preparation for the foundation of a Center for Civil Courage in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nSince 2001 Broz has headed the organization GARIWO (technically a subsidiary of the Italian non-profit body Gardens of the Righteous Worldwide) with its flagship program Education on Civil Courage.\n \nWhen her colleague and Director of  Summer School of Civil Courage, Professor Dusko Kondor was assassinated on February 22. 2007, Broz launched, in Dusko's memory, the annual Dusko Kondor Civil Courage Awards. Over the course of the 6 years of its existence, this prestigious award was given to 30 laureates.\n\nShe has organized lectures and edited and published 14 books on civil courage translated from different languages. Broz is now working on screen plays and editing documentary films for a TV series called \u201cThe Best Among Us\u201d as powerful lessons in ethics and civics for present and future generations in the West Balkans, Europe and beyond.\n\nShe has authored two books: Good People in an Evil Time \u2013 Portraits of Complicity and Resistance in the Bosnian War, translated by Ellen Elias-Bursa\u0107 (2003) and\nHaving What it Takes \u2013 Essays on Civil Courage, edited by Tom Butler, (2006).\n\nHer work is internationally recognized for its educational innovation and unique approach. She has lectured at over 100 universities in the US and Europe.\n\nAwards and honors\nBroz was honored in 2011 by French President Nicolas Sarkozy with the award of the Ordre National du Merite.\n\nShe is an honorary citizen of the city of Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, her mother's hometown. In 2007 Centro Educativo Italo Svizzero, in Rimini, Italy awarded her the La Bussola dell\u2019 Educazione \u201cMargherita Zoebeli\u201d; in 2003 the City Government of Milan, Italy awarded her L'Ambrogino d'Oro and dedicated a tree and stone to her in the World Garden of the Righteous.\n\nWritings\nGood People in an Evil Time, 2002.\nHaving What It Takes: Essays on Civil Courage, 2006\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBiography\nGARIWO Sarajevo\nSvetlana Broz Homepage\n\nCategory:1955 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Writers from Belgrade\nCategory:Writers from Sarajevo\nCategory:Physicians from Belgrade\nCategory:University of Belgrade Faculty of Medicine alumni\nCategory:Yugoslav cardiologists\nCategory:Bosnia and Herzegovina cardiologists\nCategory:Bosnia and Herzegovina journalists\nCategory:Bosnia and Herzegovina women journalists\nCategory:Bosnia and Herzegovina people of Croatian descent\nCategory:Bosnia and Herzegovina people of Slovenian descent\nCategory:Bosnia and Herzegovina people of Russian descent\nCategory:Recipients of the Ambrogino d'oro",

        "text": "Douglas Sam \"Chip\" Foose (born October 13, 1963) is an American automobile designer, artist,Geisert, Eric. \"Ron Whiteside's Ridler Winner\", in Street Rodder, July 2003, pp. 79. and star designer of the car-customization reality television series Overhaulin'.\n\nLife and career\nthumb|260x260px|Foose Design's logo\nthumb|The 2006 Hemi(s)fear at the Marconi Automotive Museum\nthumb|The custom 1960 Ford Starliner at the Marconi Automotive Museum, customized by Chip Foose\nFoose began working on automobiles at age seven for his father's company, Project Design, in Santa Barbara, California. Encouraged by Ford and Preston Tucker designer Alex Tremulis, Foose started to attend the Art Center College of Design in 1982; however, he dropped out after two years due to financial difficulties. After working for four years at Clenet Coachworks, Foose returned to the Art Center to complete his education.\n\nAfter graduating in 1990, Foose worked full-time for Sterenberger Design and part-time for Boyd Coddington. In 1993, Foose resigned from Sterenberger to work for J Mays at Ford; however, Coddington was able to convince Foose to work for him, instead. Working for Coddington full-time, Foose eventually became the president of Coddington's company, Hot Rods by Boyd. While working for Coddington, Foose designed many of Coddington's well known creations such as Boydster and Boydster II.\n\nIn 1998, with Hot Rods by Boyd facing bankruptcy (due to the failure of Boyds WheelsGeisert, Eric. \"Ron Whiteside's Ridler Winner\", in Street Rodder, July 2003, p.80.), Foose left his position and with his wife Lynne started his own automotive and product design company. He first set up in Orange, California, where, as his first project car, he rebuilt Boydster II for Chuck Svatos as the 0032 roadster, which went on to win the America's Most Beautiful Roadster (AMBR) trophy. By 2000, he had established Foose Design in Huntington Beach, California. Foose's departure from Boyd's was not amicable; in a 2006 interview, Foose stated, \"Boyd has chosen to not have any relations with me, since I stopped working at his shop.\" One of the main reasons for the bitter relationship is claimed to be Foose retained many of the talented builders formerly employed by Coddington; Mike and Charley left Coddington's business shortly after Foose had established his shop.\n\nFoose gained more exposure in 2003 as a result of a TLC documentary on his design and creation of a modified 2002 Ford Thunderbird called Speedbird, and due to his work building Ron Whiteside's 2003 Ridler-winning '34 3-window.Geisert, Eric. \"Ron Whiteside's Ridler Winner\", in Street Rodder, July 2003, pp.79-80. In 2004, the TLC program Overhaulin' debuted, with Foose as the star. At the 2005 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show, a unique 1969 Foose-designed Camaro convertible was displayed, to be produced in a 300 car run by Unique Performance of Dallas Texas. Press releases announced UP would also be handling the marketing of Foose's other custom car lines, including Hemisfear, along with Foose's 2006 Mustang Stallion. Foose also designed a paint scheme for 4-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion Jeff Gordon to promote DuPont's Hot Hues paint line. Foose has since severed ties with DuPont and now promotes the BASF Glasurit paint line exclusively.\n\nIn November 2007, Foose officially severed ties to Unique Performance following police action against UP for alleged illegal activities. In 2006, Foose launched a line of die cast replicas of many of his famous designs partnering with the makers of Johnny Lightning in the creation of JL Full Throttle. This company produced copies of many of Foose's famous, award-winning designs, including Grand Master and Impression. In 2002, Foose won the coveted Ridler Award at the 50th Anniversary Show of the Detroit Autorama with Bob and Wes Rydell's '35 Chevy Master, Grandmaster. Impression subsequently won the prestigious Ridler prize. Also replicated were a number of cars from \"Overhaulin'\". Announced at the SEMA show in 2006 was a pact between Foose and Ford to produce Foose-designed Ford vehicles, the first of which was shown at the 2007 New York Auto Show.\n\nIn 2007, Foose began limited production (50 vehicles in total) of Hemisfear. Also known as the Foose Coupe, Hemisfear was designed by Foose in 1990, during his time at the Art Center, and publicly unveiled at the SEMA trade show in November 2006. An earlier design drawing of Hemisfear inspired the Plymouth Prowler.

CDs of his composer-led ensembles have been released on several labels, including Tzadik, Cuneiform, and Innova. His compositions are informed by his identity as a drummer. He is also the author of The Producer as Composer, published by MIT Press.\n\nBiography\nMoorefield was born into a family of musicians and teachers. At the age of five, he began drumming. By the time he was ten, he spoke three languages fluently, the result of having gone to public elementary schools in Italy, the United States, and Switzerland. Moorefield attended the American School in Z\u00fcrich, giving various performances as a drummer-composer in Z\u00fcrich at the age of 17. He then received a B.A. and an M.A. in English from Columbia University, where he was a student of Edward Said. In 1979, Moorefield moved to the East Village of New York City and began a career as a composer, teaching himself along the way. His first recording, Transformations, scored for big band with electric guitars and horns, appeared in 1983. In the mid-Eighties, he began performing with rock bands such as Damage and K-Martians, which led to a stint with experimental rock band Swans.

Beginning in 1994, Moorefield has released CDs of his composer-led ensembles on various labels. In the early Nineties, he led a nine-piece group that performed meticulously notated avant-rock in Europe and the U.S. For performances at various festivals in the mid-Nineties  as well as on his Tzadik Records release, Moorefield experimented with a loosely structured hybrid between compositional and improvisational processes, coining the term \"comprovisation\" to describe his work of that period. In 1998 Moorefield received an M.F.A. in composition from Princeton University, where he studied with Paul Lansky, and a Ph.D. from the same institution in 2001. His dissertation, \"The Producer As Composer\", was published in expanded form as a hardcover (2005) and paperback (2010) by MIT Press. In the early 2000s, Moorefield began writing immersive intermedia works, at first collaboratively,  and then as large-scale compositions.

        "text": "Jean-Baptiste Maunier (, born 22 December 1990) is a French actor and singer. He is best known for his role in the 2004 French film Les Choristes.\n\nEarly life\nJean-Baptiste Maunier was born to Thierry Maunier, a cameraman, and Muriel Maunier. He has a younger brother, Benjamin. His father sang in a well-known church choir (Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint Marc). Jean-Baptiste attended a Roman Catholic school in Lyon, France. He studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York between 2008 and 2009 to perfect his acting and English, returning to France to sing in Les Enfoir\u00e9s charity concerts.\n\nCareer\n\n Acting career \nMaunier gained fame for his starring role in the 2004 French film Les Choristes, in which he plays Pierre Morhange, a delinquent with an exceptional singing voice at the correctional school Fond de L'\u00c9tang. Christophe Barratier, the director of Les Choristes, chose Maunier because \"he had the right look\" and a marvellous voice. He was also exceptionally appealing for the role.Jean-Baptiste Maunier profile, imdb.com; Retrieved 12 July 2015.\n\nFollowing the release of the film, Maunier and the choir took part in numerous concerts all over the world, including Japan and Canada. In February 2005, he left the choir in order to devote more time to his studies and to his acting career. In April and August 2005, he took part in a four-episode television series for France 2, Le Cri, playing a young steelworker. The series was released in 2006.\n\nMaunier appears in Le Grand Meaulnes (2006) as Francois Seurel. In Piccolo, Saxo et compagnie (2006), an animated film, he lent his voice to the character \"Saxo\". In the summer of 2006, Maunier acted in Hellphone, a full-length film directed by James Huth. In this film, Maunier plays the role of Sid. The film was released in March 2007.\nIn L'Auberge rouge, directed by G\u00e9rard Krawczyk (an adaptation of the 1951 version) Maunier stars as Octave. It opened in theaters in France on 5 December 2007. Jean-Baptiste spent a year studying at New York's Lee Strasberg Institute in 2008 to unleash his acting potentials. Staying in the USA allowed him to perfect his English. He returned to France in 2010, and performed in the Enfoir\u00e9s charity concert of 2010.\n\n Singing career \nUpon entering coll\u00e8ge (middle school), Maunier was asked to make a choice between various activities. He chose singing and became a member of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc (full name is \"La Chorale des Petits Enfants De Saint-Marc\"). In the choir, he was tutored by Nicolas Porte. In Les Choristes, the film that made him widely famous for his singing skills, both Maunier's solo and the chorus of \"Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc\" are featured on the original soundtrack.\n\nIn 2005, to keep a souvenir of his voice before it broke, Maunier decided to sing with Clemence Saint-Preux and had released the single, Concerto pour deux voix, which was in turn an adaptation of Concerto pour une Voix.Biography , JBMaunier.net; Retrieved 12 July 2015.\n\nSince 2005 he has participated in Les Enfoir\u00e9s, an ensemble of notable singers and performers in France that periodically performs charity concerts.

        "text": "Jens B\u00f6hrnsen (born 12 June 1949) is a German politician of the SPD who served as President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen from 2005 to 2015. From 1 November 2009 until 31 October  2010 he was President of the Bundesrat. As such, he was acting head of state of Germany from the resignation of President Horst K\u00f6hler on 31 May 2010 until the election of Christian Wulff on 30 June 2010. B\u00f6hrnsen resigned in 2015 after his party sustained losses in state parliament election.\n\nB\u00f6hrnsen is a lawyer by profession and served as a judge in Bremen from 1978 to 1995, when he became a full-time politician.\n\nBackground\nB\u00f6hrnsen was born on 12 June 1949 in Gr\u00f6pelingen, then a workers' district of Bremen, to parents active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and labor unions. His father, Gustav B\u00f6hrnsen, a communist turned social democrat, was also an SPD politician and served as chairman of the SPD group in the Parliament of Bremen 1968-1971. Jens B\u00f6hrnsen joined the SPD in 1967. At the University of Kiel, he studied law, and concluded his studies with the first Staatsexamen in 1973, and the second Staatsexamen in 1977 at the University of Hamburg. He worked as an assessor in Bremen's administration, thereafter as a judge for 17 years, before he was elected to the Parliament of Bremen (B\u00fcrgerschaft).\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1999, B\u00f6hrnsen was elected head of the SPD group of the Parliament of Bremen. On 8 November 2005, Bremen's legislative assembly elected B\u00f6hrnsen as mayor after he had won the Social Democrat primary for the office, which had become vacant with the resignation of Henning Scherf.  as a mayor and head of senate of Bremen.\n\nRecently, B\u00f6hrnsen has been involved in the debate revolving around a modernization of Germany's constitution. In the process, he rejected demands for the state of Bremen to merge with Lower Saxony to form a new northern state (a unit within Germany's federal system) \u2014 a demand that had been making the rounds as Bremen is not only the smallest German state, but has also been saddled with an extraordinary amount of debt for the past 15 years. After the 2007 state elections, B\u00f6hrnsen abandoned the coalition with the Christian Democrats (CDU) and instead started a coalition with the Greens. He is longlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award.\n\nAs president of the Senate of Bremen, B\u00f6hrnsen was elected President of the German Bundesrat for the year 2009\u20132010, starting 1 November 2009. This office rotates between the heads of government of the states of Germany following a defined schedule. According to the German constitution, the head of the Bundresrat is the designated substitute for the President of Germany. When Horst K\u00f6hler resigned from the presidency on 31 May 2010, B\u00f6hrnsen assumed the functions of head of state of Germany until the election of a successor by a Federal Convention. The successor was Christian Wulff, who assumed office upon his election on 30 June 2010.\n\nAfter his party lost more than five percentage points in the state election on 10 May 2015, B\u00f6hrnsen retired as head of government. His successor was Carsten Sieling.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCityMayors profile\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\nCategory:1949 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Presidents of the German Bundesrat\nCategory:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians\nCategory:Members of the B\u00fcrgerschaft of Bremen\nCategory:Mayors of Bremen (city)\nCategory:Acting heads of state of Germany\nCategory:University of Hamburg alumni\nCategory:University of Kiel alumni",

He also appeared in three 2013\u201314 UEFA Youth League group stage matches with the under-19 team.\n\nAPOEL\nAfter being released by Manchester United, he signed a three-year contract with APOEL on 24 April 2014. On joining the club, Ioannou commented: \"My main aim is to win trophies of course, but obviously I need to start playing.

        "text": "Bob Raku\u0161an (born 6 February 1948, Prague) is a Czech contemporary artist, who creates large-fired enamel works on black steel plate, scrap and salvaged objects, such as stove tops and ovens. The foundation layers of the enamel are often built on screen techniques inspired by the printing process. His work is rooted in drawings, studies and graphic prints. Besides landscapes and abstract and figurative composition, there is a recurring ocean theme in his works, inspired by his longtime occupation as a captain of sailing ships.\n\n Career \nFrom 1966-68 Raku\u0161an spent two years studying figurative drawing and painting in the studio of Professor Frantisek Nedved. He also studied expressive painting, with materials including charcoal, ink and pastel. At the same time he was also studying at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, where his professors included Josef Novak, Franti\u0161ek Muzika, and later Milan Hegar.\n\nIn 1969, Raku\u0161an left the Czech Republic on a short assignment to a ceramics factory in West Germany to produce designs for Keramik Fabrik Schardt in Rheinbach, resulting in a thematic series of ceramic design templates. During this period he also began composing large and small scale mosaic pieces for private collectors. At the end of this assignment Raku\u0161an had an individual exhibition in Bonn at the Opel Autosalon Bachem, his first independent show. The success of the show resulted in a two-month delay to his return to university, which had adverse consequences for his studies.\n\nIn 1973, after finishing his studies, Raku\u0161an focused on commercial illustration and graphic arts for a number of magazines, book publishers and companies, creating posters, logos, advertising and book designs, and illustrations for children, while also exhibiting work in Jaroslav Fragner's gallery.\n\nAt the end of the seventies, after the birth of his first son David, Raku\u0161an returned to formal and independent art. A major turning point in his career was a group exhibition titled Mult in Copenhagen in 1981, in which his work was juxtaposed and contrasted with pop art and avant-garde. The contrast had a strong impact on Raku\u0161an that significantly altered the theme and composition of his future work. The birth of his second son Luke in 1983 forced Raku\u0161an to focus on commercial endeavours, such as magazine graphics and illustration work.\n\nBeginning in 1988, the artist returned to his work full-time. In the interim period Raku\u0161an had gained experience with serigraphic and other kinds of printing, which informed his technique. He also started producing his early enamel work, exhibiting a collection of these at the Salon of Prague Artists in the Park of Culture and Leisure ().\n\n Large enamel firing technique \nThe final exhibition of his graphic work took place in 1989 at the graphics Salon of Applied Arts in Prague, in the Culture and Leisure Park. In 1988, the entry into his enamel phase was marked by a group exhibition: New Painting in the Student House of Czech Technical University in Prague. During this time and until the end of 1990, the Raku\u0161an's work was also exhibited in a travelling exhibition through Germany (H\u00f6chst im Odenwald, Zweibr\u00fccken, Darmstadt). This exhibition of paintings and enamels gradually became more focused on enamel works, marking a shift to enamel fired works.\n\nFrom 1992, the artist ceased artistic production and devoted himself to sailing for the next five years, captaining ships from Germany, Croatia, Italy, Sweden and France from 11 to 16 meters in length. Sailing, and the ocean, became a recurring theme in his later work after this period.\n\nIn 1997 he rededicated himself to artistic production, introducing new and modern techniques, primarily through the use of computer-aided graphic design. From 2012 to 2013, Solidet Gallery in Prague hosted a solo exhibition of Raku\u0161an's original enamels and graphic prints.\n\n Gallery \n\nReferences\n\n External links \n The Fine Art Archive\n Galerie Solidet, Praha, Czech republic\n Galerie Picasa, Bob Raku\u0161an enamel art\n Archive Frakfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 17.4.1990, Lebendiges Darmstadt - April 1990, Pfalzischer Merkur 27.3.1990, Odenwalder Heimatzeitung 21.9.1989, Kv\u011bty 25.8.1988\n National Library Drawings, paintings, enamels: Gallery Hall High i Odw; graphics, enamels, sculpture: Japan Bank in Frankfurt\n\nCategory:1948 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Czech painters\nCategory:Czech male painters\nCategory:Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague alumni",

He has a combined range of 3 octaves but has spanned an additional octave while performing \"Opera\", a rearranged instrumental by Vitas, a song he stated he cannot practice (including perform) more than 4 times a day.  He later became the first Taiwanese artist to record his album in One Take and One Take Live with no further editing.\n\n Life and career \nLin was born in Keelung, Taiwan, and is the oldest of 3 children.  In 1991, as a university student, he formed the duo Ukulele with Lee Chi and gained attention in Taiwan and Hong Kong with their debut album \"Confession\" (\u8a8d\u932f).  The band made 4 Mandarin albums, 2 English cover albums, and a compilation album before disbanding in 1996.  He was working at a power plant in a mine, but his colleague were all killed in a landslide, so he moved on to work in his father's family publishing company, for which he is still the equivalent of COO.  In 1999, he was forced to leave the music industry to care for his mother.  Nine months after the leave, his mother died, and the original publishing building was forced to rebuild due to a fire.\n\nLin went solo in 1995 and signed to Sony Music before setting up his own agency in 1997.  In 2018, he sung Mo Dao Zu Shi's opening song \"Drunken dreams of a past life\".\n\n Influences \nWhile Terry Lin is fluent in Taiwanese Hokkien, and his ancestry is in Hokkien, China, his father does not think it suits him as his voice and pronunciation are not compatible. Terry has covered songs from artists such as Steel Heart, Celine Dion, Queen, Air Supply, Vitas, Simon & Garfunkel, Ardian Rrusta. He cited Air Supply as one of his biggest influences.\n\n Philanthropy \nTerry Lin has been the Chairman of Taiwan Cancer Hope Fund since his mother's passing in 2001, and was awarded HKMT (Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan-wide) Top Philanthropist Award in 2013.\n\n Variety show \n I Am a Singer Season 1 \nIn February 2013, he joined the first season of Hunan Television's I Am a Singer, where he finished runner-up.\u7fbd\u6cc9\u7206\u51b7\u596a\u51a0\u3000\u6797\u5fd7\u70ab\uff1a\u4e0d\u518d\u53c3\u52a0\u300a\u6211\u662f\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\n\nI Am a Singer Season 1 Terry Lin's performance listEpisodeBroadcast DateSong TitleOriginal SingerRankingPercentages of Votes Remarks 5 (Qualifying Round 3)  February 15, 2013  \"\u6c92\u96e2\u958b\u904e\" (Mandarin)  Terry Lin  1  21.86%  \u2014 6 (Knockout Round 3)  February 22, 2013  \"Fade Away\" (Mandarin)  Jay Chou  3  14.62%  2nd place in Overall ranking 7 (Qualifying Round 4)  March 1, 2013  \"Opera\"  Vitas  2  18.14%  \u2014 8 (Knockout Round 4)  March 8, 2013  \"\u4f60\u7684\u773c\u795e\" (Mandarin)  Tsai Chin  1  27.25%  2nd place in Overall ranking 9 (Qualifying Round 5)  March 15, 2013  \"Making Love Out of Nothing At All\" (English)  Air Supply  1  27.15%  10 (Knockout Round 5)  March 22, 2013  \"\u591c\u591c\u591c\u591c\" (Mandarin)  Chyi Chin  3  19.57%  5th place in Overall ranking 11 (Revival Round)  March 29, 2013 Exempted (did not perform that week) 12 (Semi-finals)  April 5, 2013  \"\u65b7\u4e86\u7dda\" (Mandarin) \"Go Home\" (Mandarin)  Mindy QuahShunza  2  17.44%  \u2014 13 (Grand Finals- Round 1)  April 12, 2013  \"Easy Lover\" (English)  Phil CollinsPhilip Bailey  2  15.60%  Backup singer was Jam Hsiao 13 (Grand Finals- Round 2)  \"\u6d6e\u8a87\" (Mandarin)  Terry Lin  2  36.47%  2nd place in Overall ranking (and runner-up of I Am a Singer Season 1)\n\n Singer 2017 \nIn February 2017, Lin returned as a returning singer of the fifth season of I Am a Singer, which was renamed to Singer on that same season.

        "text": "thumb|alt=This person\nChen Yu (Chinese: \u9673\u59a4; pinyin: Ch\u00e9n Y\u00fa; born 7 May 1994) is a Taiwanese actress. After graduating from Chinese Culture University, Chen gained her reputation across various films and television productions from several genres, and made her screen debut with the television series Love of Sandstorm in 2016, and her film career began with the movie Back to the Good Times. She went on to star in several commercially successful series and films, including the series The World Between Us (2019) and the film Do You Love Me As I Love You (2020).\n\n Early life \nChen Yu was born on 7 May 1994, in Taiwan, into a family of five.\u00a0 Her father is an audio recording engineer, her mother is a voice actress,\u00a0and she has two older brothers. After graduating from the Department of Theater Arts at Chinese Culture University, Chen Yu has been involved in performing since childhood, due to his experiences of\u00a0participating in cartoon voice acting.\u00a0 During high school, she was active in school events and activities, taking advantage of the opportunity of performing in the strict private school she attended.\u00a0 \"At school with such strict rules, joining in practicing dancing and rehearsing is the time to 'take a breath'.\" She said in the interview with Flipped Education that she enjoyed participating in group works and performing on the stage. \u00a0\n\nHowever, Chen Yu did not think of becoming an actress before getting into college.\u00a0 In fact, she had decided to study biology or chemistry due to her academic performance in those subjects.\u00a0 When applying for colleges, Chen Yu put Department of Theater Arts as her last choice on the list only because her mother graduated from the department.\u00a0 Walking on the acting path out of coincidence, Chen Yu met her abecedarian, Yen Ling Hsu, just after getting into college.\u00a0 Professor Hsu had not only enlightened her in performing but also impacted her sense of values.\n\nBeing brought up by a domestic worker in the family, Chen Yu initially had a difficult relationship with her parents.\u00a0 Chen Yu had been raised like a boy, like her two brothers. She thought \"Between working and taking care of children, my parents chose the former.\" \u00a0 After growing up, Chen Yu gradually reconciled with her parents.\u00a0She started to consider her mother as an advice-giver, and her father as a problem-solver.\u00a0 Chen Yu has been deeply influenced by her family.\u00a0 Chen Yu shared her father\u2019s words in her interview: \"Life is like a sponge.\u00a0 You need to learn as long as you can because you don\u2019t know when things will come in handy.\"\n\n Acting career \n\n 2014\u20132016 \nIn 2014, Chen Yu was studying in the department of Drama and Theatre at Chinese Culture University and started to participate in stage shows. In 2015, she became a trainee in the acting training of QPlace, furthermore, the training after being selected helped Chen Yu truly realize her true calling as an actress.\n\n 2016\u20132018 \nIn 2016, Chen Yu made her debut as an actress, and her casting began for Love of Sandstorm filmed by Qseries.  In her personal interview, she revealed that the most challenging thing for her was to perform crying. When she read the script, she thought she could cry; however, she could not cry when acting.  In 2017, she got the Golden Bell Award for Best New Performer in a Television Series and a nominee for the Golden Bell Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series by Love of Sandstorm. These are affirmations of her acting skills. In the same year, she also participated in House of Toy Bricks and What She Put on the Table produced by Qseries. She was one of the guest actors in Lion Pride. Displaying Befriend and Utopia For The 20s, she was the supporting actress in both dramas in 2018.\n\n 2019\u20132023 \nIn 2019, Chen Yu starred in The World Between Us. Her acting skills were recognized by the audience and critics. This TV series stimulated public discussion about indiscriminate killing and the dilemma of the news media.  Therefore, it\u00a0received outstanding ratings. When Chen Yu acted in The World Between Us, she liked her role very much, and the role she played was vivid for her. However, Chen Yu was too concerned about gain and loss and\u00a0too eager to be good, so she thought she performed not that well. After that, she could adjust her mentality better. In the same year, she also starred in Taiwanese idol dreams D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and Before We Get Married.\n\nIn 2020, Chen Yu first starred as a leading actress in the movie Do You Love Me As I Love You. Although it is never easy to be the lead actress, she still regained her cheerfulness in filming. Compared to her participation in The World Between Us, she showed a completely different charm when filming Do You Love Me As I Love You. From her initial fright to her present familiarity, she thinks she has fumbled through her acting experience over the years.\u00a0 Furthermore, more people know about Chen Yu through this work. Chen Yu also acted in the Taiwanese television drama Cometesting and the Political television series Island Nation.\n\nIn the series More Than Blue, Chen Yu acted as the special guest star, Chen Xian-an. This tearjerker caused a sensation by the careful production and its reputation. She acted as a supporting actress in a Taiwanese romantic fantasy comedy movie Till We Meet Again in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Chen Yu thought that she had always been recorded as her characters but rarely recorded as Chen Yu, so she attended All Star Sports today. It was her first time attending a game show, which was quite different from being an actress. She had to join physical training for up to six months and endure the impact of an injury on her work schedule. Being able to be recognized by the audience through this reality show is another kind of luck. She can show her true personality in front of the audience without reservation. Not only attending the game show, she also acted in Golden Dream On Green Island produced by Qseries 2 as a\u00a0 special starring in the same year.\n\nIn 2023, Chen Yu starred as the leading actress in\u00a0three types of dramas: the movie Mystery Writers, the TV series Could I have your LINE, daughter? and the television film Space Boy.\n\n Work\u00a0 \n\n Love of Sandstorm\u00a0(2016) \nThe romantic comedy series Love of Sandstorm centers around the Lin family's journey to navigate their complex family dynamics, learn from their love experiences, and mature in the process. In the series, Yu played the role of Yi-Shan Lin, the eldest daughter in the Lin family, who grappled with a love triangle and the difficult decision of whether to give in to her romantic interest or not.\n\n The World Between Us (2019) \nThe Taiwanese television drama series, The World Between Us, falls under the genre of drama and crime. It garnered a significant following in Taiwan, with its final episode earning a television rating of 3.4. The series received 24 award nominations, with 10 of them resulting in wins. The show incorporated elements from various domains, such as news, laws, medical care, and social welfare. It was the first Taiwanese TV series to explore random killing and address sensitive topics like media controversy and schizophrenia. The series raised social issues like how the public should treat the perpetrator's family and the line between good and evil. The playwright, Shih-yuan Lu, wrote the script out of fear of random killings. The show resonated with many viewers who found it emotionally impactful. In the series, Yu played the character of Li, Ta-Chih, the sister of the perpetrator. Li, Ta-Chih, faced public scrutiny and criticism for her association with her brother's actions. She learned to navigate through this challenging situation with her family and cope with the negative attention. Chen Yu received a nomination for the Huading Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series for her role in this series.\n\n Do You Love Me As I Love You (2020) \nDo You Love Me As I Love You is classified as a teen movie and depicts the complex relationships between teenagers and the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with love. The film received three nominations at the Taipei Film Awards and was a commercial success, earning over 20 million NTD within three days of its release. In the movie, Yu played the role of Tien, Xiao-Xiang, the protagonist who harbored unrequited feelings for Li, Zhu-Hao for a significant period. However, Li, Zhu-Hao confessed his love for Tien's best friend, Song Yi-Jing, which led Tien, Xiao-Xiang to confront the issue of a love triangle.\n\n Personal life \n\n Relationships \nChen Yu publicly came out as bisexual in 2019\u2019s ETtoday interview. She revealed that she had once dated a woman for two years while they were both studying at Chinese Culture University. Despite this, Chen Yu stated that she does not consider sexual orientation as a factor in relationships and feels comfortable with her gender identity. However, she acknowledged that it took a lot of time and discussions with her parents, and she believes that there is still much education and discussion needed in the future. Throughout the interview, she emphasized that her personal life is private and that she hopes people will focus more on her work.\n\nIn 2021's Liberty Times Net interview, Chen Yu mentioned that she was dating a chef who was four years older than her. They have been dating each other since 2016.\n\n Personal hobbies \nChen Yu stated that she loves to engage in outdoor activities in 2019's Ms. Ocean interview. During the interview, she shared the outdoor activities she had learned so far. She expressed a preference for sports that require technical problem-solving skills, stating that she finds the challenge exhilarating. Among her hobbies are swimming, skateboarding, bouldering, and freediving, which she particularly enjoys.\n\nIn 2019, Chen Yu was chosen as a charity ambassador for\u00a0Zenan Homeless Social Welfare Foundation. The events she participated in were mainly for those needy and destitute people in society. As a charity ambassador, Chen Yu called for improvements to the lives of those in need. She also promoted the charity events held by Zenan Homeless Social Welfare Foundation by filming a short clip on its official YouTube channel to promote the events mentioned above.\n\n References \n\nCategory:1994 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:21st-century Taiwanese actresses\nCategory:Taiwanese film actresses\nCategory:Taiwanese television actresses\nCategory:Chinese Culture University alumni\nCategory:Place of birth missing (living people)",

Mulroney later made a public apology. After Exeter's video gained significant attention, Mulroney lost her contracts with Hudson's Bay, ABC, Cityline and CTV (her CTV series I Do, Redo was cancelled). Following the incident, Mulroney's husband resigned from etalk on June 22. National Post opinion columnist Barbara Kay was given private access to previously undisclosed texts and messages between Mulroney and Exeter. Kay argued in her January 21, 2021, column that Mulroney was threatened and bullied by Exeter and that Mulroney's own threats to Exeter had thus been provoked.\n\nCharity\nMulroney and her sisters-in-law Caroline, Katy, and Vanessa Mulroney co-founded the charity The Shoebox Project for Shelters, aiming to assist homeless and at-risk women. In 2020, following the controversy involving Sasha Exeter, Mulroney stepped down from her role in the project.\n\nPersonal life\nOn October 30, 2008, Brownstein married Ben Mulroney, the eldest son and second eldest child of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mila Mulroney. The couple have three children.\"Mulroney Baby Girl Arrives For Ben and Jessica\", The Huffington Post Canada; retrieved June 18, 2013.\n\nMulroney was considered to be a close friend of the Duchess of Sussex (n\u00e9e Meghan Markle), whom she met in 2011 while she was working in Toronto. In 2018, she and her husband attended her wedding to Prince Harry, and their children participated as page boys and flower girl. During her 2020 feud with Sasha Exeter, Mulroney described Markle as her \"closest friend\" with whom she had experiences \"where race was front and centre\", a statement which was reportedly perceived by the Duchess to exploit their friendship. Mulroney later denied the rumors of a rift with Markle.\n\n References \n\nCategory:1980 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Canadian women philanthropists\nCategory:Fashion stylists\nCategory:Canadian Jews\nCategory:Canadian philanthropists\nCategory:McGill University alumni\nJessica",

        "text": "Eric \"E.\u00a0D.\" Donald Hirsch Jr.  (born March 22 1928) is an American educator, literary critic, and theorist of education. He is professor emeritus of humanities at the University of Virginia.\n\nHirsch is best known for his 1987 book Cultural Literacy, which was a national best-seller and a catalyst for the standards movement in American education. Cultural Literacy included a list of approximately 5,000 \"names, phrases, dates, and concepts every American should know\" in order to be \"culturally literate.\" Hirsch's arguments for cultural literacy and the contents of the list were controversial and widely debated in the late 1980s and early '90s.\n\nHirsch is the founder and chairman of the non-profit Core Knowledge Foundation, which publishes and periodically updates the Core Knowledge Sequence, a set of unusually detailed curriculum guidelines for Pre-K through 8th grade.\n\nIn 1991, Hirsch and the Core Knowledge Foundation put out What Your First Grader Needs to Know, the first volume in what is popularly known as \"the Core Knowledge Series.\" Additional volumes followed, as did revised editions. The series now begins with What Your Preschooler Needs to Know and ends with What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know. The \"series\" books are based on the curriculum guidelines in the Core Knowledge Sequence. The books are used in Core Knowledge schools and other elementary schools. However, they have also been popular with homeschooling parents.\n\nBefore turning to education, Hirsch wrote on English literature and theory of interpretation (hermeneutics). His book Validity in Interpretation (1967) is considered an important contribution to hermeneutics. In it, Hirsch argues for intentionalism\u2014the idea that the reader's goal should be to recover the author's meaning.\n\n Early life and education \nHirsch was born on March 22, 1928, in Memphis, Tennessee. His parents were Eric Donald Hirsch Sr. and Leah (Aschaffenburg) Hirsch. His father was a cotton broker who worked for Allenberg Cotton and was honored as \"Cotton Man of the Year for 1956.\"Cornell Alumni News, 1 April 1957, p. 169.\n\nHirsch was educated in Memphis public schools, the Pentecost Garrison School (Memphis), the Metairie Park Country Day School (New Orleans), and the Todd School for Boys (Woodstock, Illinois).\n\nIn 1950, Hirsch graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York with a B.A. in English. After a brief stint in the naval reserves, he enrolled in the Ph.D. program in English literature at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He completed his doctorate in 1957.\n\nWork on the Romantic poets\nFrom 1956 to 1966, Hirsch taught in the English Department at Yale University. During this time most of his academic work concerned the English Romantic poets.\n\nHirsch's first book, Wordsworth and Schelling, was a revision of his doctoral dissertation. In the book, he explicates Wordsworth's philosophic ideas and poems by juxtaposing them with the ideas of the German philosopher Friedrich Schelling .\n\nIn 1964, Hirsch published his second book, Innocence and Experience: An Introduction to Blake. In this book Hirsch took issue with \"systematic\" critics of Blake's work, including Northrop Frye and Harold Bloom. Hirsch argued that Blake's ideas and outlook changed radically over time and that early works like The Songs of Innocence do not express the same worldview as later works like The Songs of Experience.\n\nUVA and Hermeneutics\n\nHirsch was hired to teach English at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1966. The next year, he published Validity in Interpretation (1967). This was his first book-length work on hermeneutics and theory of interpretation. However, it was not his first published work on the subject. He had previously published an article, \"Objective Interpretation\" (PMLA, 1960) and a review of the German edition of Hans-Georg Gadamer's Truth and Method (Review of Metaphysics, 1965). Both of these early pieces are reprinted as appendices in Validity in Interpretation.\n\nIn Validity in Interpretation Hirsch defends what he calls \"the sensible belief that a text means what its author meant.\" He argues that it is possible (at least in some cases) for readers to recover an author's intended meaning\u2014and that readers should make this the goal of interpretation. Hirsch makes a distinction between the \"meaning\" of a text, which does not change over time, and the \"significance\" of the text, which does change over time. In addition, he argues that objectivity in interpretation is possible and that we can have objective knowledge in humanistic studies.\n\nIn a review of important works on interpretation, Sherri Irvin gives the following summary of Validity in Interpretation:   The seminal statement of actual intentionalism: Hirsch holds that \u2018meaning is an affair of consciousness and not of physical signs or things\u2019 (23), though he allows that linguistic convention constrains the meanings the author can intend for a particular utterance. He argues that the author's intention is necessary to fix meaning, since the application of conventions alone would typically leave a text wildly indeterminate.   Hirsch's \"intentionalist\" and \"objectivist\" views on hermeneutics are close to those of the Italian jurist Emilio Betti. On the other hand, his views run largely contrary to the views of Martin Heidegger and his student Hans-Georg Gadamer as well as the views of W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley on the \"semantic autonomy\" of works of literature, as expressed in \"The Intentional Fallacy.\"\n\nHirsch continued to publish on hermeneutics and the concept of authorial intent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and many of his articles from this period are collected in his second book on hermeneutics, The Aims of Interpretation (1975).\n\nHirsch's views on hermeneutics have been widely cited\u2014Google Scholar lists more than 4,400 citations for Validity in Interpretation\u2014but they have also been widely criticized.\n\nComposition and Theory of Writing\nIn the early 1970s Hirsch began working  on the theory of writing and composition, publishing several articles and a book, The Philosophy of Composition (1977). The central concept in this book is the idea of \"relative readability.\" One piece of writing is more readable, in terms of relative readability, than another if it conveys the same meaning but is easier to read and is read more quickly than the alternative passage. The Philosophy of Composition was widely reviewed and generated a lot of discussion in composition circles for several years, but Hirsch's work in this area is no longer widely discussed.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Hirsch and some colleagues at the University of Virginia ran a series of experiments on relative readability. Participants in the experiments were assigned either a well written passage or a poorly written (stylistically degraded) version of the same passage. Hirsch and his colleagues recorded reading time to determine whether the well written passages were in fact read more quickly, as they predicted they would be. They discovered that they were. However, they also discovered that there was another factor that was even more important than relative readability: if the students lacked crucial background knowledge, they struggled to read both the poorly written and the well written passage. This became particularly clear while Hirsch was running tests at a Virginia community college. The students at the community college did not know who Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee were and, as a result, they struggled to make sense of a passage on the U.S. Civil War. Hirsch observed that these students lacked \"cultural literacy\". They had adequate decoding skills for reading, but they began to struggle when they lacked relevant background knowledge.\n\n Cultural Literacy \n\nHirsch was dismayed that community college students, raised in Virginia, where much of the Civil War was fought, had not heard of Robert E. Lee, who commanded the Confederate States Army or Ulysses S. Grant, who led the Union Army, or the roles these men played in the American Civil War. He began to push for the teaching of cultural literacy in grades K-12, and especially K-8. His main objective, as he has frequently noted, was to help disadvantaged students to cultural literacy and improved reading comprehension.\n\nIn a 1981 presentation to the Modern Language Association, Hirsch introduced his theory on the connection between literacy in general and cultural literacy. A version of his MLA paper was published in 1983 as an article, \"Cultural Literacy,\" in The American Scholar.\n\nIn 1983, the Exxon Education Foundation provided support for further research. With this funding, Hirsch set up a team who began to compile lists of terms that \"culturally literate\" people know but young people and disadvantaged people may need to learn. This would become the appendix of his 1987 book, an unannotated list of approximately \"5,000 names, phrases, dates, and concepts,\" representing the \"necessary minimum of American general knowledge\".\n\nIn 1986, Hirsch established the non-profit Cultural Literacy Foundation, with a goal of developing a fact-rich core curriculum and piloting it in selected elementary schools.\n\nIn 1987, Hirsch's Cultural Literacy appeared. The book became a national bestseller, rising to #2 on the New York Times Bestseller lists. Hirsch's book was often reviewed with and discussed in tandem with another education book published at roughly the same time, Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind. These two books convinced many readers that there were problems with American education. Hirsch's book \"spurred a growing movement for prescriptive cultural literacy and standards in general.\" This resulted in a recommendation by the United States Department of Education that \"cultural literacy should inform the content of the American educational system.\"\n\nHirsch has distanced himself from Bloom book, saying that \"That was just bad luck\u00a0... Allan Bloom really was an elitist.\"\n\nIn 1988, Hirsch co-authored the Dictionary of Cultural Literacy with Joseph Kett and James Trefil. In 1989, Hirsch was the editor of A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy. In 1991, Hirsch and his colleagues issued What Your First Grader Needs to Know, the first in the popular Core Knowledge series.\n\nOne early supporter of the Core Knowledge movement was Columbia University's Diane Ravitch, an education historian. Against the backdrop of the release of a scathing report on education in the United States\u2014A Nation at Risk\u2014Ravitch encouraged Hirsch to publish Cultural Literacy as a non-fiction book in 1987. The book included an unannotated list of approximately \"5,000 names, phrases, dates, and concepts\" every American should know in order to be culturally literate.By the time her 2016, reprint of her best-selling book was published, Ravitch had become disillusioned with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Common Core initiative that had produced presented a \"comprehensive, coherent sequence of thematic curriculum units connecting the skills outlined in the CCSS with suggested student objectives, texts, activities, and much more (Schneider 2019) becoming disillusioned by the Gates\u2019-funded Common Core. She said the \"fundamental error of the Common Core standards is that they were written by a small group of people without the involvement of classroom teachers and scholars in the respective fields. They were written with remarkable speed but without any public review process. There were no means by which to revise them after they were published. States could add up to 15 percent additional content, but could subtract or change nothing. It was a missed opportunity to do it right. The toxicity of the Common Core standards persuaded me that it is fruitless to rely on national curriculum standards as a solution to education problems.\"\n\nBy 1988, Hirsch was featured in the New York Times, as a \"self-proclaimed crusade against noneducation\" in his role as president of the Cultural Literacy Foundation which was headquartered in Charlottesville. The Foundation monitored the \"spread of ignorance and illiteracy in the United States\" and made \"proposals for remedying it\".\n\nBy 1990, the Core Knowledge  had approximately 2,500 members and was largely self-supporting, although they continued to use grant money for large projects.\n\nBy 2015, Hirsch and his Core Knowledge Foundation, had become an \"increasingly popular primary source for the Common Core movement\". The emphasis is placed \"more on what should be known rather than how to know\"\u2014\"content knowledge\" is central to learning and \"knowledge acquisition is treated as a commodity or product to be dispensed\".\n\n Criticism of school systems\nIn his 1996 book The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them, Hirsch was highly critical of the American education system, which he described as a \"Thoughtworld\" hostile to research-based findings and dissenting ideas.\n\nThroughout his career, Hirsch denounced the influence of 19th century romanticism on American culture in general, and on progressive educational ideas in particular. He said that romanticism, and writers and artists who espoused the romantic world-view \u2014 such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge \u2014 \"elevated all that is natural and disparaged all that is artificial\". Hirsch sees the romanticism-inspired progressivists as being in opposition to the intellectuals \u2014 the classicist, the modernist, the pragmatist, and the scientist.\n\nIn The Schools We Need Hirsch said that, \"Higher-level skills critically depend upon the automatic mastery of repeated lower-level activities.\" In his 1999 book, The Schools Our Children Deserve: Moving Beyond Traditional Classrooms and Tougher Standards, Alfie Kohn said that Hirsch's \"starting with the basics\" model  \"reflects a particular model of learning\"\u2014behaviorism\u2014\"which has lost credibility among experts in the field even as it retains a stranglehold on the popular consciousness\".\n\nIn 2006, Hirsch published The Knowledge Deficit, in which he continued the argument made in Cultural Literacy.  Disappointing results on reading tests, Hirsch argued, can be traced back to a knowledge deficit that keeps students from making sense of what they read. While Hirsch's observation that \"students cannot make sense of what they read\" was correct, he did not necessarily connect it to the fundamental issues why students were having trouble reading. The investigative work done by the investigative journalist, Emily Hanford, and published through the podcast \"sold a story\", throws light at the fundamental reasons behind lack of reading literacy amongst almost a whole generation of American children.\n\nIn 2009, he published The Making of Americans: Democracy and Our Schools, in which he makes the case that the true mission of the schools is to prepare citizens for participation in our democracy by embracing a common-core, knowledge-rich curriculum as opposed to what Hirsch claims to be the current content-free approach.  He laments 60 years without a curriculum in US schools because of the anti-curriculum approach championed by John Dewey and other Progressives.\n\nIn 2016, he published \"Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories\", outlining the three major problems with education in the United States: the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is \"appropriate\" for their age.\n\n Core Knowledge\nHirsch established the non-profit Core Knowledge Foundation and serves as its director. The Foundation began publishing its Core Knowledge Sequence in the 1990s. This includes eight books as part of the Core Knowledge Grader Series of books. The series begins What Your Preschooler Needs to Know and ends with What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know. The series, which has been revised and updated over the years, have been particularly popular with parents who homeschool, as well as parents whose children attend Core Knowledge schools.\n\nIn 2011 a British version of The Core Knowledge Sequence was published online.The UK Core Knowledge Sequence. The books began to be adapted for the UK, beginning with What Your Year 1 Child Needs to Know.The official partnership in the UK\n\nBy 2015, there were about 1,260 schools in the US (across 46 states and District of Columbia) using all or part of the Core Knowledge Sequence. The Foundation believes that the actual number is much higher, but only counts schools that submit a \"profile form\" to the Foundation annually. The profile of Core Knowledge Schools in the US is diverse\u2014including public, charter, private and parochial schools in urban, suburban and rural locations. Independent nonprofit GreatSchools.org reports that more than 400 of these schools are preschools.\n\nIn his 2014 article published by Thomas B. Fordham Institute, Robert Pondiscio, the author of How the Other Half Learns in which he reviewed Success Academy, Pondiscio said if the Common Core State Standards Initiative was \"properly understood and implemented\", it would be a \"delivery mechanism\" for Hirsch's \"ideas and work\" and his Core Knowledge curriculum. Hirsch was not directly involved in developing the Common Core State Standards adopted in 46 states and the District of Columbia, some education watchers credit E.\u00a0D. Hirsch as having provided the \"intellectual foundation\" for the initiative. Pondiscio said that Politico had paired  David Coleman\u2014main author of the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts\u2014with Hirsch in eight place on their 2014 list of fifty \"thinkers, doers and dreamers who really matter.\"\n\n Reviews of Hirsch's work\nA 1999 Baltimore Sun article said Hirsch's system had succeeded in \"producing educated children\" but ignited an \"education controversy\" which has been \"very good for [Hirsch's] business\". Hirsch said that he specifically designed a curriculum that would \"place all children on common ground, sharing a common body of knowledge. That's one way to secure civil rights.\"\n\nSol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, described Hirsch's \"curriculum for democracy\" in 2009, as \"content-rich pedagogy\" that makes better citizens and smarter kids. Sterne said in 2013 that Hirsch was \"the most important education reformer of the past half-century.\" Stern said that William Bennett, a prominent conservative who served as Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities and later US Secretary of Education, was an early proponent of Hirsch's views.\n\nThe Core Knowledge Foundation self-describes itself as non-partisan. Hirsch himself is an avowed Democrat who has described himself as \"practically a socialist\" In his 2010 article in the Claremont Review of Books, Terrence O. Moore cited Hirsch, who self-described as a \"political liberal\" had been \"forced to become an educational conservative\". Moore said that Hirsch's Left was the \"Old Left\". In The Making of Americans (2010), Hirsch said that, he was a \"political liberal\" who was \"forced to become an educational conservative\" after he had \"recognized the relative inertness and stability of the shared background knowledge students need to master reading and writing.\" He said that the \"democratic goal of high universal literacy would require schools to practice a large measure of educational traditionalism\".\n\nIn his 2009 article, published online by Grove City College's Institute for Faith and Freedom, Jason R. Edwards\u2014who teaches education and history at Grove City College\u2014said that Hirsch has been criticized by the political left for being an \"elitist\" whose theories could result in a \"rejection of toleration, pluralism, and relativism\". On the political right, Hirsch has been accused of being \"totalitarian, for his idea lends itself to turning over curriculum selection to federal authorities and thereby eliminating the time-honored American tradition of locally controlled schools\".\n\nHarvard University professor Howard Gardner, who is best known for his theory of multiple intelligences, has been a long-time critic of Hirsch. Gardner described one of his own books, The Disciplined Mind (1999), as part of a \"sustained dialectic\" with E.\u00a0D. Hirsch, and criticized Hirsch's curriculum as \"at best superficial and at worst anti-intellectual\". In 2007, Gardner accused Hirsch of having \"swallowed a neoconservative caricature of contemporary American education.\"\n\nUK Education Secretary (Michael Gove)\n\nMichael Gove, who served as Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and then Secretary of State for Education under Prime Minister David Cameron from 2010 to 2014, oversaw major controversial education reforms. Gove admired Hirsch's theories of education, according to a 2012 article in The Guardian. Gove revised the national curriculum, which included \"hard facts\", allegedly influenced by Hirsch. In 2014, the Core Knowledge books were published in the U.K. by Civitas, which is widely characterised in the national news media as \"right-of-centre\". Standardized testing conducted by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) had faced criticism since at least 2008, as a threat to social learning.\n\nA 2010 article in the U.K.-based TES described Core Knowledge as a \"kind of national curriculum\" that outlines Hirsch's ideas on what \"children should know in English language and literature, history, geography, maths, science, music, and art\".\n\n Influence in other countries \n Portugal \nE.\u00a0D. Hirsch was first invited to Portugal in 2004 by the then minister of education David Justino and then participated at two conferences organized by Nuno Crato. On the occasion, he was interviewed by various media. His points of view were part of the public educational debate developed for a few years after his visit.\n\nLater, his ideas were very influential, namely during the tenure of minister Nuno Crato (2011\u20132015) in which the curricula were reorganized and detailed learning outcomes (\"metas curriculares\") were introduced. These learning outcomes explicitly highlight the essential knowledge students should master and were built in a progressive, systematic, and layered fashion inspired by Hirsch's ideas. Various analysts attribute to these rigorous and demanding standards, among other factors, the notable 2015 improvement in Portuguese student results in PISA and TIMSS international studies.\n\n Personal life\nHirsch was married to Gertrud Erna Winkelsen from 1956 and from 1958 to Mary Monteith Pope until her death in 2015.Obituary of Mary Pope Hirsch: https://lcnme.com/obituaries/mary-pope-hirsch/ He is currently married to Natasha \"Tasha\" Tobin.* \n\nHe has four children.\n\n Fellowships, awards and memberships \nHirsch has been awarded several fellowships and honors, including the Fulbright Fellowship (1955), the Morse Fellowship (1960), the Guggenheim Fellowship (1964), the Explicator Prize (1965), the NEA Fellowship (1970), the NEH Senior Fellowship (1971\u201371), the Wesleyan University Center for the Humanities Fellowship (1973), the Princeton University Fellowship in the Humanities (1977), and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences Fellowship at Stanford University (1980\u201381).\n\nAt the University of Virginia he was Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Emeritus, in addition to Professor of Education and Humanities.\n\nHe has received honorary degrees from Rhodes College and  Williams College.\n\nHe is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a board member of the Albert Shanker Institute.

Analysis of property damages and local government building records showed that newer structures were more likely to have been damaged by the storm, and the team argued that easing the zoning, inspection, and building codes had caused greater storm losses, largely in a 16-page article \"What Went Wrong\". The newspaper won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service citing its coverage \"that not only helped readers cope\u00a0... but also showed how lax zoning, inspection and building codes had contributed to the destruction.\"\"Public Service\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-11-04.\n\nDoig's analysis of voting patterns in Florida in led him to believe that had there been no errors in vote counting in Florida during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Democratic Party candidate Al Gore would have won the state's electoral votes instead of Republican Party candidate, and, thereby, the ultimate winner of the U.S. Presidency, George W. Bush.\n\nEarly years\nServed in the United States Army, where he taught at the Defense Information School. Also served a year a combat correspondent in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\n\nReception\nIn 1990 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) awarded Doig the Responsibility in Journalism award for his work as a Science Editor for the Miami Herald.\n\n See also \n\n Crowd counting\n \n \n\n References \n\n External links \n\n Steve Doig, Knight Chair in Journalism  at Arizona State University\n \"Reporting With the Tools of Social Science: \u2018We had put the social scientists on notice that journalists increasingly would be competitors in their field\u2019\" by Stephen K.

He competed in the free skate at three ISU Championships \u2013 2012 Four Continents in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States; 2012 Junior Worlds in Minsk, Belarus; and 2013 Junior Worlds in Milan, Italy, being the second male figure skater to ever represent Brazil at an ISU competition. He was awarded the best figure skater in Brazil prize by the Brazilian Olympic Committee in 2011. In 2015, he was chosen the Brazilian embassador for the 2016 Winter Youth Olympic Games by the Brazilian Olympic Committee.\n\n Personal life \nManella moved to Miami when he was eight years old.\n\n Career \nLuiz Manella started skating lessons when we was 12, in order to be able to play ice hockey, however, figure skating caught his attention and a year later he switched. In 2009, he took part in American local competitions.\n\nIn 2010, his then coach got in touch with the Brazilian Ice Sports Federation, who invited Manella to represent the country at JGP Ostrava, which was his first official competition as a Brazilian skater.\n\nManella competed exclusively as a junior up until the 2012-13 season, when he changed coaches with the goal of getting the first ever figure skating spot for Brazil at the Winter Olympic Games. His first senior international competition was the 2013 US Classic where he finished in 10th place. At the 2013 Junior Worlds, he managed to get the best ever result for a Brazilian skater after he finished in 15th place, although not being able to directly get a spot for the Olympics. He tried again to get an Olympic spot at the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy but was unsuccessful, becoming second alternate.\n\nIn the next season, the Brazilian federation suggested him to switch to pair skating with Karolina Calhoun, who was also a Brazilian junior skater, however the plans were not successful after Calhoun got injured. In late 2014, Manella was invited to train with Hwi Choi, from South Korea. They were coached by Ingo Steuer, until Manella retired due to injury.\n\n Programs \n Season Short program Free skating 2013\u20132014   A Day in the Life  Gladiator  2012\u20132013   Matrix  Gladiator  2011\u20132012   Take Five  Xotica \n Ancient Lands \n\n Results \n International Event 2010\u201311 2011\u201312 2012\u201313 2013\u201314 Four Continents   22nd   Nebelhorn Trophy    23rd  12th U.S. Classic    10th  International: Junior Junior Worlds   16th  15th   Czech Republic  15th     Italy   7th    Latvia     WD  JGP = Junior Grand Prix; WD = Withdrew \n\n References \n\n External links \n\n \n Luiz Manella at Tracings\n\nCategory:Brazilian male single skaters\nCategory:1995 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Sportspeople from Londrina\nCategory:Sportspeople from Miami\nCategory:Brazilian emigrants to the United States\nCategory:21st-century Brazilian sportsmen",

She previously was a member of the National Assembly and a minister.\n\nEarly life\nMorano was born on 6 November 1963 in Nancy, France. Her father was a truck driver. Her mother, Monique Generelli, was a switchboard operator, daughter of a Piedmontese mason from Verbano-Cusio-Ossola.\n\nPolitical career\nMorano served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2008, representing Meurthe-et-Moselle.

        "text": "Clive Thompson (born 30 October 1968) is a Canadian freelance journalist, blogger, and science and technology writer.\n\nEarly life and education\nThompson grew up in the 1970s and the 1980s in Toronto, Canada. He spent his childhood working with early models of computers. He tried to understand programs for games and for artificial intelligence as a child but did not succeed, so he chose not to study science.\nThompson graduated from the University of Toronto with majors in political science and English in 1992. He previously worked for Canada's Report on Business magazine, This Magazine, and Shift magazine, then became a freelance contributor for The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, Lingua Franca, Wired, Shift, Entertainment Weekly and several other publications.\n\nProfessional work\n\nThompson writes about digital technologies and their social and cultural impact for a number of publications, including the New York Times Magazine and Wired.\nThompson originally wrote about the emergence of technology, much like Nicholas Carr, another author on the subject. However, Thompson now describes the \"global self-expression\" afforded to humanity by new forms of media. He writes about how tools affect how we think, but states that there are benefits from social thinking on internet. Thompson developed the idea of \"ambient awareness,\" or the connections humans develop with each other through quick status updates throughout the day that ultimately end up being deep, intellectual and still social. He does acknowledge that ambient contact has caused the world to become too focused on the present. For Thompson, the internet is text that one can use to talk, argue, insult and compliment others with. Thompson stated in an interview that the internet will never replace cities because cities are too dynamic to replicate through technology. Thompson also states that cities and technology are connected because both are a way to foster connections. He writes that humanity is not yet overwhelmed by technology, and that humans have always faced new challenges with technology.\nThompson's blog, Collision Detection, started in 2002 and attracts over 3000 hits a day.\n\nAwards and accolades\nIn 2002, he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT.\n\nPersonal life\nThompson is married to The New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum. They live in Brooklyn, New York, with their two children. Thompson plays guitar and harmonica in a band called The DeLorean Sisters. Thompson also wrote music for the duo Cove.\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Canadian male bloggers\nCategory:Canadian expatriate journalists in the United States\nCategory:Wired (magazine) people\nCategory:The New York Times journalists\nCategory:1968 births\nCategory:University of Toronto alumni\nCategory:Technology writers\nCategory:Technology journalists",

He was drafted 21st overall by the Blue Jackets in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPlaying career\nChinakhov played as a youth with his hometown club, Avangard Omsk. Following the 2018\u201319 MHL season, spent mainly with Omsk's Junior Hockey League (MHL) affiliate, he went undrafted in the 2019 NHL Draft. He remained in the MHL for the 2019\u201320 season, improving his point totals tremendously.\n\nAt the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, Columbus made the surprising decision to select Chinakhov in the first round, 21st overall. While the consensus among scouts was that Chinakhov would be selected in the second or third round, there were very few public rankings that ranked him in the top 100, with many lists excluding him entirely. In their coverage of the draft, NBC Sports did not have any footage to share of Chinakhov as they did for every other first round selection and many in the following rounds.\n\nChinakhov made his professional debut in the 2020\u201321 season with Omsk's senior club, in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was named the Rookie of the Month for the month of September 2020, during which he recorded three goals and two assists in nine games, averaging 11 minutes and nine seconds of ice time. He finished with 10 goals and 7 assists for 17 points in 32 regular season games, leading all KHL players 20 years or younger in points-per-game (0.53). In the postseason, he added 5 goals and 7 points in 21 games to help the club win the Gagarin Cup for the first time in franchise history.\n\nthumb|Chinakhov (right) battling with Oliver Bjorkstrand of the Seattle Kraken in 2024.\nChinakhov was signed by the Columbus Blue Jackets to a three-year, entry-level contract on May 2, 2021. He played most of the 2021\u201322 season for the Blue Jackets, scoring 14 points in 62 games.\n\nChinakhov played the beginning of the 2022\u201323 season with the Blue Jackets, improving his scoring rate to 13 points in 30 games, before being placed on injured reserve (IR) with an ankle injury on December 20, 2022. On February 27, 2023, he was activated from IR and assigned to the Jackets' minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL), finishing the season with 8 points in 7 AHL games.\n\nFollowing another injury, sustained just one day before the 2023\u201324 season, Chinakhov was again assigned to the AHL on October 25, 2023.\n\nInternational play\nChinakhov represented Russia at the 2018 Hlinka Gretzky Cup, where he recorded one goal and two assists in five games, and won a bronze medal.\n\nHe represented Russia at the 2019 IIHF World U18 Championships, where he recorded two goals and one assist in seven games, and won a silver medal.\n\nChinakhov made his World Junior Championship debut at the 2021 championship, playing 5 games as Russia finished fourth.\n\nPersonal life\nChinakhov is the son of former ice hockey player Vitali Chinakhov, who was selected in the 11th round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers and never played in the NHL.\n\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\nRegular seasonPlayoffs Season Team League GP  G  A  Pts  PIM GP  G  A  Pts  PIM2017\u201318 Omskie Yastreby MHL 4  1  4  5  2 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u20142018\u201319 Omskie Yastreby MHL 37  8  8  16  4 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u20142019\u201320 Izhstal Izhevsk VHL 2  2  1  3  0 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u20142019\u201320 Omskie Yastreby MHL 56  27  42  69  16 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 2020\u201321 Avangard Omsk KHL 32  10  7  17  6 21  5  2  7  24 2021\u201322 Cleveland Monsters AHL 1  1  0  1  0 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 2021\u201322 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 62  7  7  14  16 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 2022\u201323 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 30  4  9  13  10 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 2022\u201323 Cleveland Monsters AHL 7  3  5  8  0 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 2023\u201324 Cleveland Monsters AHL 3  3  1  4  2 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 2023\u201324 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 53  16  13  29  6 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014KHL totals 32  10  7  17  6 21  5  2  7  24NHL totals 145  27  29  56  32 \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014\n\nInternational\n Year Team Event Result  GP G A Pts PIM 2018 Russia HG18  5 1 2 3 0  2019 Russia U18  7 2 1 3 4 2021 Russia WJC 4th 5 1 0 1 0 Junior totals  17 4 3 7 4\n\nAwards and honors\n Award Year KHL Gagarin Cup (Avangard Omsk) 2021 \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:2001 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Avangard Omsk players\nCategory:Cleveland Monsters players\nCategory:Columbus Blue Jackets draft picks\nCategory:Columbus Blue Jackets players\nCategory:HC Izhstal players\nCategory:NHL first-round draft picks\nCategory:Russian ice hockey right wingers\nCategory:Ice hockey people from Omsk\nCategory:21st-century Russian sportsmen",

        "text": "Sarah Jane Olney ( McGibbon; born 11 January 1977) is a British Liberal Democrat politician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park since 2019, previously holding the seat from 2016 to 2017. Olney has served as the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the Treasury from July 2022 to 2024. And for business and industrial strategy from January 2020 to 2024, she currently serves as Spokesperon for the Cabinet Office since September 2024.\n\nOlney was first MP for Richmond Park for six months, from a by-election in December 2016 to the general election in June 2017, before she regained the seat at the 2019 general election, facing off against Zac Goldsmith in both elections. She was the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for international trade from January to September 2020 and for education from May to June 2017. While out of Parliament, she was a financial accountant for Historic Royal Palaces, from 2018 to 2019.\n\nEarly life and career\nSarah McGibbon was born in Frimley on 11 January 1977 to Ian and Rosalyn McGibbon. She was educated at All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham and then studied English Literature and Language at King's College London. She initially worked as a bookseller in Hatchards, Piccadilly, from 1998 to 2000.\n\nOlney became a qualified accountant at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants in 2016. She worked as an accountant at Barclays, Arts & Business, Distilled Ltd, SCi Sales Group and the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington until she entered politics after the 2015 general election.\n\nOlney joined the Liberal Democrats in July 2015, having said that she was a liberal dissatisfied with the direction of the United Kingdom.\n\nParliamentary career\nOn 25 October 2016, Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith announced his resignation from the House of Commons over his objection to his party's support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport, triggering a by-election in his seat of Richmond Park. Goldsmith stood in the by-election as an independent candidate. On 30 October 2016, Olney was announced as the Liberal Democrats' candidate for the by-election. At the by-election, Olney was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park, with 49.6% of the vote and a majority of 1,872.\n\nAfter her election to Parliament, Olney reaffirmed her opposition to the building of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.\n\nShortly after her election, Olney ended a radio interview in which she was pressed on her support for a second Brexit referendum. Supporting a second referendum subsequently became official Liberal Democrat policy shortly.\n\nOlney voted against the triggering of Article 50, as she had indicated during the by-election campaign that she would do so. She believed that another referendum should have been held once the exact terms of Britain's exit from the EU had been announced. \n\nIn the run-up to the snap 2017 general election, Olney was recorded urging Liberal Democrats to vote for Labour MPs in seats where Labour candidates stood a better chance of defeating Conservatives, rather than Liberal Democrat candidates. Olney referred to the Liberal Democrat candidate for Ealing Central and Acton as a \"paper candidate\" and voiced her support for the incumbent Labour Party MP Rupa Huq. \n\nAt the snap 2017 general election, Olney lost her seat in Richmond Park, coming second with 45.1% of the vote behind Zac Goldsmith, who stood as the Conservative candidate.\n\nOn 9 September 2017, it was announced that she would be taking up the post of chief of staff for Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable.\n\nIt was reported by the Evening Standard in April 2018 that Olney had been interviewed under caution by the police for allegedly breaking official spending limits in the Richmond Park by-election. The Crown Prosecution Service ruled that there was no evidence, and closed the case.\n\nIn 2019, she was officially confirmed as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Richmond Park at the next general election. At the 2019 general election, Olney was elected as MP for Richmond Park with 53.1% of the vote and a majority of 7,766.\n\nIn May 2021, alongside celebrities and other public figures, Olney was a signatory to an open letter from Stylist magazine which called on the government to address what it described as an \"epidemic of male violence\" by funding an \"ongoing, high-profile, expert-informed awareness campaign on men's violence against women and girls\".\n\nOlney was re-elected to Parliament as MP for Richmond Park at the 2024 general election with an increased vote share of 55.4% and an increased majority of 17,155.\n\nOn 3 December 2024, Olney's ten minute rule bill calling for the voting system to adopt proportional representation passed on a symbolic vote.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2002, she married Benjamin (Ben) James Olney, a town planner presently working as a manager for High Speed 1. The couple have a son and a daughter. They have also had another son, who is deceased.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n Richmond Park Liberal Democrats\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nCategory:1977 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Alumni of King's College London\nCategory:British accountants\nCategory:British women accountants\nCategory:Liberal Democrats (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nCategory:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies\nCategory:21st-century British women politicians\nCategory:UK MPs 2015\u20132017\nCategory:UK MPs 2019\u20132024\nCategory:UK MPs 2024\u2013present\nCategory:21st-century English women\nCategory:21st-century English politicians",

        "text": "Gajendra Singh Sareen (born 7 November 1966) is an Indian-Singaporean businessman, founder, CEO, and president of Singapore tire manufacturer and distributor, Omni United Pte. Ltd.\n\n Early life \n\nSareen was born on 7 November 1966 in Madhya Pradesh to a middle-class family. He is the youngest of four siblings. His father, Dr Surender Singh Sareen, was a civil servant; his mother, Amrit Kaur Sareen, was paralyzed after being involved in an accident while visiting Africa. His brother, Paremendra Singh Sareen, died in a road accident in 1989 at the age of 27.\n\n Education \n\nSareen is an alumnus of Daly College Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India and holds a degree in Statistics from Bhopal University.

So far the company has donated over US$1.4 million, funding 28,000 hours of research to the cause.\n\n Rewa Vineyards \n\n The estate \n\nIn 2012, Sareen acquired a vineyard in Coombsville AVA and named it after his wife, Rewa. The estate spans over 43 acres and is located in the providential rocky knoll in the volcanic hills of Coombsville which has a geologic history dating back 9 million years. The Vineyard produces a Sauvignon Blanc wine and two Cabernet Sauvignon wine.\n\n Awards and recognition \nThroughout his career as the founding President and CEO of Omni United, Sareen has received many awards and recognitions.

In 2014, he was featured in \"The Peak\" magazine's anniversary publication as one of 30 men and women documenting their success stories - the \"30/30 \u2013 The Game Changers\".\n\n Personal life \n\nIn 1994, four years after their marriage, Sareen and his wife Rewa Manmohan Singh Sareen (born 4 Feb 1968) made the decision to relocate to Singapore. In 2009, Sareen took up citizenship in Singapore before launching two tire businesses, including Mindtrac.com, and establishing Omni United in 2003.

He is the member of Parliament representing Kira municipality in the 10th Parliament (2021 to 2026).\n\nBackground and education\nSsemujju was born in Bijaaba Village, Kyazanga Municipality, Lwengo District, on 23 September 1973. At that time, Lwengo District was still part of Masaka District. He is the son of Hajji Ali Nganda Nkwanga and Hajati Sophia Nalwooga, one of his forty-eight children and one of her sixteen offspring.\n\nHe attended the Bijaaba Islamic Institute, \"a few meters from his birthplace\", obtaining the Primary Leaving Certificate while there. After the institute started a secondary school section, Ssemujju joined. However, by Senior 2, most of his female classmates had found husbands and dropped out, while his male cohorts left for odd jobs in nearby Masaka Town. He raised whatever little capital he could and convinced his father to enroll him in Masaka Secondary School for his Senior 3 studies. At that time, he barely spoke any English, but they admitted him anyway.\n\nHe progressively did well and passed his O-Level examinations in 1992. He went on to pursue his A-Level education, also at Masaka Secondary School. He graduated at the top of his class in 1995. He was admitted to Makerere University, on a full Ugandan government scholarship to study mass communication. He graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts mass communication.\n\nCareer\nStraight out of Makerere, he was hired as a reporter for the Daily Monitor, one of the two leading English language daily newspapers in Uganda, serving in that role until 2004. His beat was coverage of the Ugandan parliament. From 2000 until 2001, he taught journalism at the Islamic University in Uganda. In 2004, he left the Daily Monitor to join The Observer, both as a reporter and as a shareholder. He was assigned the role of political editor at the Weekly Observer, serving in that role until 2011. In 2009, he was assigned additional duties as the editor, educational news. In 2011, he resigned from his journalism assignments to contest the parliamentary seat of Kyaddondo County East. He ran on the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) political party platform. He won and is the current incumbent. Prior to the February 2016 presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, Kira Municipality was awarded a parliamentary seat, separate from Kyaddondo East. Ssemujju is contesting for that seat under the FDC political party banner.\n\nOther considerations\nIn parliament, he chairs the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises. He is also a member of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs and of the Business Committee. He is married to Faridah Ssemujju, and together are the parents of three daughters and three sons.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWebsite of the Parliament of Uganda\nMP Ssemujju Nganda Violently Arrested \u2013 19 October 2012\nSsekandi Hails Churches for Social, Spiritual Development\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Makerere University alumni\nCategory:Ugandan journalists\nCategory:People from Lwengo District\nCategory:Ganda people\nCategory:1973 births\nCategory:Forum for Democratic Change politicians\nCategory:Members of the 9th Parliament of Uganda\nCategory:Ugandan Muslims\nCategory:Academic staff of the Islamic University in Uganda\nCategory:Members of the 10th Parliament of Uganda\nCategory:Members of the 11th Parliament of Uganda",

Nickerson had a try-out with Danish team Esbjerg IK in November 2010 but failed to secure a contract. \nThe Fife Flyers confirmed the signing of Matt Nickerson for the 2013/14 Rapid Solicitors Elite Ice Hockey League season.\nNickerson quickly became a fan favorite at Fife where his tough edge added some much needed backbone to a team which had been bullied on the ice in the past. Playing 45 games in his first season he was an integral part in the run to the EIHL playoff semi final game where Fife lost to Belfast by 1-0. His unending desire to stand up for his team mates earned great respect from the Fife support although he did draw the attention of the EIHL referees and in December 2013 he was handed a 12-game suspension (which was reduced upon appeal) for a fight during a game against the Braehead Clan. \nAs part of the Fife Flyers community outreach program Nickerson and team mates visited the children's hospice in Kinross operated by C.H.A.S.

        "text": "Angelique Widjaja (; born 12 December 1984) is a retired Indonesian professional tennis player. She won the junior championships at Wimbledon in 2001, defeating Dinara Safina, and the 2002 junior French Open defeating Ashley Harkelroad. She reached a peak of No. 55 in the WTA singles rankings in March 2003, and a peak of No. 15 in the doubles rankings in February 2004.\n\nCareer\nWidjaja started playing tennis at the age of four. She first began playing at ITF juniors events in 1998 at the age of 13. Her first professional event was an event in Jakarta in April 1999, when she was 14 years old.\n\nShe enjoyed considerable success as a junior player. In 2001, she won the singles competition of the junior championships at Wimbledon, defeating Dinara Safina 6\u20134, 0\u20136, 7\u20135. In so doing, she became the first Indonesian to win any title at Wimbledon. In 2002, she won the doubles competition of the Australian Open Junior Championships, partnered by Gisela Dulko. That year, she also won the singles competition of the junior championships at the French Open. She reached a peak junior rank of No. 2. Also, she obtained an invite from \"Hong Kong Tennis Patrons' Association\" to play The Hong Kong Ladies Challenge in January 2002.\n\nThe first WTA Tour tournament she won was the 2001 Wismilak International in Bali, a Tier III event, which she entered at the age of 16 on a wildcard. She was the youngest Indonesian ever to win a WTA singles title. Her WTA singles rank prior to the tournament was No. 579, and as such was the lowest-ranked player ever to win a WTA singles title.\n\n2002 was her most successful year in Grand Slam singles competition, reaching the second round at three consecutive majors. At the French Open, she defeated Jill Craybas in the first round. She was beaten by Evie Dominikovic in the second round. At Wimbledon, she beat 15th seed Anna Smashnova in the first round, before losing to Meilen Tu in round two. At the US Open, she beat Anna Kournikova in the first round, and was eliminated in the next round by St\u00e9phanie Foretz.\n\nWidjaja represented Indonesia at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, collecting a silver medal in the women's doubles with partner Wynne Prakusya, and also the gold medal in the team event.\n\nIn November 2002, she won a second WTA tournament, the Tier V event at Pattaya.\n\nShe continued to perform well on the WTA Tour through 2003. After her third-round exit from the Tier I tournament at Indian Wells in 2003, she reached her career's highest rank: No. 55. She remained in the top 100 for the remainder of 2003.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, Widjaja enjoyed considerable success in doubles competition, primarily partnered by Mar\u00eda Vento-Kabchi. The pair reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2003, and the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2004. They also won a Tier III event at Bali in 2003, and reached the final of one Tier I event, the 2003 Canada Masters. Following the 2004 Australian Open, Widjaja reached No. 15 in the WTA doubles rankings. This was her peak doubles rank.\n\nThrough 2004, Widjaja appeared in the mixed-doubles competition of all four majors. Her best result came at the French Open, where she and partner Lucas Arnold Ker beat Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova to reach the quarterfinals. There, they lost to the French pair Tatiana Golovin and Richard Gasquet.\n\nWidjaja played at the 2004 Summer Olympics at Athens. She defeated Tamarine Tanasugarn in the first round of the singles competition, but was beaten by Karolina \u0160prem in the second round. She also took part in the doubles competition, partnered by Wynne Prakusya, and they were eliminated in the first round.\n\nThrough 2005, Widjaja took a hiatus from professional tennis due to various injuries. Following her return in 2006, she did not replicate her previous success, and did not take part in any singles competitions in WTA or ITF events after that year, but did remain active in doubles competition.\n\nIn 2007, she was part of the Indonesian women's team that won the silver medal at the SEA Games in Thailand.\n\nIn 2008, at the age of 23, Widjaja and partner Liza Andriyani won the doubles competition of an ITF tournament in Jakarta.

        "text": "Josh Matlow (born November 27, 1975) is a Canadian politician who has served on the Toronto City Council representing Ward 12 Toronto\u2014St. Paul's since 2010.\n\nMatlow ran as the Ontario Liberal Party candidate in the 2002 Dufferin\u2014Peel\u2014Wellington\u2014Grey  byelection, losing against Progressive Conservative Premier Ernie Eves. Matlow was a Toronto District School Board (TDSB) trustee between 2003 and 2010 before his election to council representing St. Paul's. He was elected to City Council following the 2010 municipal election, and was re-elected in 2014, 2018 and 2022. Matlow ran for mayor of Toronto in the 2023 by-election.\n\nEarly life and education\nMatlow was born in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Ted Matlow, was a federally appointed judge and his mother, Elaine Mitchell, was a retired high school teacher. He studied political science at Concordia University and attended L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, France.\n\n Career \nBefore entering politics, Matlow was an actor. He performed in festivals, did comedy improv and television commercials.\n\nMatlow was a co-director of Earthroots, an Ontario environmental non-governmental organization. He also worked for the Canadian Peace Alliance, organizing against the war in Iraq.\n\nMatlow has written articles for several local newspapers including the Toronto Sun and Toronto Star. He hosted a call-in radio show on University of Toronto station CIUT, was a weekly contributor and co-host on Toronto talk-radio station AM 640 and CFRB. He hosted a talk radio show called The City with Josh Matlow on Toronto radio station Newstalk 1010 and was a weekly columnist for the Toronto Star.\n\nPolitical career\nIn 2002, at the age of 26, Matlow was asked by the Ontario Liberal Party to run as their candidate in Dufferin\u2014Peel\u2014Wellington\u2014Grey in a by-election against Progressive Conservative Premier Ernie Eves. He lost by 3,560 votes.\n\n TDSB Trustee (2003\u20142010) \nIn 2003, Matlow was elected to the Toronto District School Board as a trustee and re-elected to the same position in 2006. He worked on a number of initiatives including installation of solar panels on school rooftops, keeping school pools open, and helping students to achieve 'economic literacy'.\n\nIn 2008, Matlow spoke out against a proposal to create an Africentric school in Toronto. He instead favoured the widespread implementation of a more 'culturally diverse' curriculum.\n\n Toronto City Councillor \n\n Elections \nMatlow was first elected during the 2010 Toronto municipal election as the councillor for Ward 22 St. Paul's. In an interview with the Toronto Star following the election, he identified fostering a sense of community as a priority for his ward. He criticized the city's public consultation process, and committed to holding town hall meetings with residents.\n\nHe was re-elected in the 2014 election with the highest vote count (24,347) and highest winning percentage (86.2%) of any councillor candidate across the city. In 2018, Matlow was re-elected in the newly formed Ward 12 Toronto\u2014St. Paul's, beating fellow councillor Joe Mihevc, who represented Ward 21 St. Paul's before his ward and Matlow's were amalgamated. He was re-elected in the 2022 election.\n\nMatlow has been endorsed by the Toronto Star editorial board in the 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022 elections.\n\n Political stance \nMatlow initially positioned himself as a political centrist during his first term.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with BlogTO, he proposed contracting out garbage collection services and allowing unions to compete in the tender, citing frustrations during the 2010 strike. He also supported asking the province to declare transit an essential service, which would prohibit workers from striking. Matlow supported the repeal of a vehicle registration tax, calling for a reevaluation of financing relations with the province. He also expressed his dislike of the land transfer tax, however, did not support a repeal as it would leave a large revenue gap in the city budget.\n\nLater in his career, Matlow shifted to the left, describing himself as a \"pragmatic progressive\" in 2023. He has supported issues such as a judicial inquiry of encampment clearings, reducing the police budget, and increasing property taxes to offset a transit fare increase.\n\n Scarborough transit extension \nIn his first term, Matlow supported the light rail transit (LRT) proposal over Mayor Rob Ford's proposal to construct a shorter extension of Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth to replace the aging Line 3 Scarborough. He refers to the LRT as the \"evidence-based\" transit option, arguing that it serves more people within walking distance and would have been fully funded, instead of requiring the city to take on additional expenses for a subway extension. In 2013, city council ultimately decided to proceed with the subway extension.\n\nIn February 2015, Matlow raised a number of administrative inquiries relating to ridership, the cost of cancelling the LRT project, as well as proceeding with a subway extension. The city manager's response confirmed that city staff did not know how many people will ride the Scarborough subway, where it will go, or how much it will cost. In 2018, Matlow called for a judicial inquiry to investigate what he described as \"dysfunctional\" transit planning, citing lack of information and misinformation that was provided to council.\n\n COVID-19 \nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Matlow became the first known Canadian politician to go into quarantine on March 9, 2020, after coming into close contact with a person who had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n Toronto Police Service funding cut \nIn 2020, Matlow, along with Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam put forward a motion in Toronto City Council to reduce the Toronto Police Service (TPS) budget by 10 percent ($122 million), reinvest the police budget into community programs, and allow city council to read the line by line police budget they vote on. The motion was defeated.\n\n Integrity Commissioner rulings \nIn 2017, the integrity commissioner ruled that Matlow breached the council code of conduct by making claims on a radio show that a city staff member had misled council in 2016. City Manager Peter Wallace asked Matlow to apologize after hearing the interview, which he subsequently did. Following the commissioner's report, Matlow said he was \"clearly wrong in pointing at a specific name\", but \"firmly stand by the concerns\" he raised.\n\nIn 2018, TTC CEO Andy Byford submitted a complaint to the integrity commissioner, who later ruled that ruled that Matlow again breached the code of conduct when he made comments on a radio show questioning the objectivity of staff's advice.\n\nIn 2023, the integrity commissioner ruled that Matlow breached the code of conduct in two separate instances. In the first complaint, he claimed in a tweet that staff had \"lied\" to him about the opening date of park bathrooms.\n\nThe second complaint was filed by Interim City Manager Tracey Cook, who Matlow claimed made a \"decisions to omit facts\". The commissioner recommended that council dock 10 days of pay from Matlow due to \u201can escalation\u201d of his misconduct and his history of breaching the code of conduct.\n\n 2023 mayoral by-election \nMatlow announced on March 21, 2023, his intention to run for mayor of Toronto in the 2023 by-election. He lost to Olivia Chow on June 26, finishing in 5th place with 35, 572 votes (4.91%).\n\nIn an interview with the Toronto Star, Matlow described his approach as \"pragmatic progressive\", and committed to improving city finances and services through cost savings and a property tax increase. He noted a city report which identified a $46.5 billion in budget pressures over the next decade, promising to take meaningful action to address it.\n\nHe proposed increasing property taxes and introducing a two per cent annual \"city works fund\" charge. The new fund would generate $78 million per year to be directed towards service and infrastructure improvements, costing the average household an additional $67 a year.\n\nMatlow would pause plans to rename Dundas Street. He has also said he intends to ask council to re-evaluate the plan to rebuild the eastern portion of the Gardiner Expressway, stopping its rehabilitation and replacing it with a less expensive boulevard option. He criticized former deputy mayor Ana Bail\u00e3o's plan to ask the province to take over the highway, describing it as \"unrealistic\".\n\nMatlow proposed establishing a $115 million community health and safety fund, which would be spent on programs to combat the root causes of crime, such as through mental health supports. The program would be financed by diverting funding increases to the $1.16 billion police budget for three years. The Auditor General's Office and Toronto Police Services Board would support TPS in finding budgetary efficiencies.\n\nElection results\n\nMunicipal\n2023 Toronto mayoral by-election'''CandidateVotesVote shareOlivia Chow269,37237.17%Ana Bail\u00e3o235,17532.45%Mark Saunders62,1678.58%Anthony Furey35,8994.95%Josh Matlow35,5724.91%Mitzie Hunter21,2292.93%Source: City of Toronto\n2022 Toronto Municipal Election, Ward 12 Toronto\u2014St. Paul'sCandidateVotesVote shareJosh Matlow22,67084.7%Bryan Ashworth2,0457.6%Bob Murphy1,1754.4%Antonio Corpuz8923.3%Total26,782Source: City of Toronto\n2018 Toronto municipal election, Ward 12 Toronto\u2014St. Paul'sCandidateVotesVote shareJosh Matlow20,37151.60%Joe Mihevc16,63442.14%Ian Lipton9302.36%Elizabeth Cook9082.3%Bob Murphy3420.87%Artur Langu2900.73%Total39,475Source: City of Toronto\n2010 Toronto municipal election, Ward 22 St. Paul'sCandidateVotesVote shareJosh Matlow11,89252.39%Chris Sellors8,03735.40%Elizabeth Cook1,9008.37%William Molls8693.82%Total22,698Source: City of Toronto\n\nProvincial\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCategory:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections\nCategory:Canadian environmentalists\nCategory:Toronto District School Board trustees\nCategory:1975 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Toronto city councillors",

        "text": "Steven Michael Wojciechowski (born August 11, 1976), also known as Wojo, is an American basketball coach and former player who is currently the head coach for the Salt Lake City Stars of the NBA G League. He previously played and coached under head coach Mike Krzyzewski at Duke University and was the head coach at Marquette University for seven seasons. He was a point guard from 1994 to 1998. \n\nBiography\n\nPlaying career\n\nHigh school\nWojciechowski is a 1994 graduate of the Cardinal Gibbons School in Baltimore, Maryland, where he played under Baltimore Catholic League head coach Ray Mullis. Rated one of the top high school players in the country, Wojciechowski was named to the East squad of the 1994 McDonald's All-American Team, playing against future Duke teammates Trajan Langdon and Ricky Price.\n\nDuke\nHighly recruited out of high school, Wojciechowski signed to play with Duke.\n\nMidway through Wojciechowski's freshman season, the Duke coach, Mike Krzyzewski, had to take a medical leave. The team stumbled to a 13\u201318 record, the school's only losing season since 1982\u201383; it was also Duke's only non-NCAA-tournament season between 1983 and 2021.\n\nDuring Wojciechowski's last three years, the Duke Blue Devils achieved an 74\u201326 record. A captain during his senior year, Wojciechowski led that 1997\u201398 team to a 32\u20134 record and a #1 ranking in the final AP regular season poll. In the NCAA tournament, the Duke team reached the South Regional final, losing to the eventual champion, Kentucky, 86\u201384.\n\nDuring that senior year, Wojciechowski was named NABC Defensive Player of the Year honors and was an honorable mention All-American.\n\nOverall, Wojo appeared in 128 games for Duke, starting 88. He is ranked eighth at Duke for career steals (203) and eighth for career assists (505).  He also achieved the second highest number of steals in a single season with 82 in 1997.\n\nA first-generation college student, Wojciechowski earned his bachelor's degree from Duke in 1998.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Duke, Wojciechowski played professional basketball in Poland for a year.\n\nCoaching career\n\nDuke\n\nHe returned to Duke in 1999 as an intern in the Duke Management Company and was a basketball analyst on the Duke Radio Network.\n\nWojciechowski was then offered a coaching job by Krzyzewski and began his career as an assistant coach in 1999. He was promoted to associate coach in 2008. During his 14 years on the Duke bench, Wojciechowski primarily coached Duke's frontcourt players. Two of them, Shane Battier and Shelden Williams, were national defensive players of the year, while those who went on to successful NBA careers include Carlos Boozer, Rodney Hood, Josh McRoberts, Jabari Parker, Mason Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, and Lance Thomas. Compiling an overall record of 441\u201392 during his time as an assistant and associate head coach, the Blue Devils won the NCAA championship in 2001 and 2010.\n\nWojo was also an assistant on the USA National senior team from 2006 to 2014, including the teams that won the Olympic gold medal in 2008 and 2012.\n\nMarquette\nOn April 1, 2014, Wojciechowski was hired as the new Marquette head basketball coach, replacing Buzz Williams, who left for Virginia Tech. At Marquette, he compiled a 124\u201393 record, including two NCAA tournament invitations. This included a losing record during his first season followed by 5 consecutive winning seasons. However, with no Big East titles and an 0\u20132 NCAA Tournament record in 7 seasons, Wojciechowski was fired at the conclusion of the 2020\u20132021 season.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Marquette profile\n\nCategory:1976 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American expatriate basketball people in Poland\nCategory:American men's basketball players\nCategory:American people of Polish descent\nCategory:Basketball coaches from Maryland\nCategory:Basketball players from Maryland\nCategory:Duke Blue Devils men's basketball coaches\nCategory:Duke Blue Devils men's basketball players\nCategory:Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball coaches\nCategory:McDonald's High School All-Americans\nCategory:People from Severna Park, Maryland\nCategory:Point guards\nCategory:Salt Lake City Stars coaches\nCategory:Shooting guards\nCategory:Sportspeople from Anne Arundel County, Maryland",

        "text": "Ronald Grams (born July 26, 1982) is an American professional wrestler. He is known for his 18-year tenure with the Chikara professional wrestling promotion, under the name Icarus since 2002, where he is a former Grand Champion, Campeon de Parejas and King of Trios winner. He has also wrestled for Combat Zone Wrestling, Dragon Gate USA, Evolve Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nGrams received his initial training from Chikara founders Mike Quackenbush and Reckless Youth at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, where he was trained on the first term of the school alongside the likes of Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. Grams and Hallowicked were childhood friends and entered the school with the intention of becoming a tag team.\n\nChikara\nNight Shift (2002)\nGrams made his professional wrestling debut on May 25, 2002, at Chikara's first ever show as Ichabod Slayne, a masked member of the rudo (bad guy) stable Night Shift, with partners Blind Rage and Hallowicked. In their first professional wrestling match, Slayne and Hallowicked were defeated by Beauty and the Beast (Marshal Law and Love Bug) in a tag team match. When Hallowicked began gaining success as a singles wrestler, Slayne and Blind Rage were left to represent Night Shift in the company's tag team division. However, it wasn't long before problems rose between the two, culminating on June 28, 2002, in a ten-man tag team match, where Blind Rage's misstep caused Slayne to be pinned and as a result he was forced to wear a dress. On November 16 Slayne surprised his tag team partner by appearing as a member of the opposing tecnico (good guy) team in an eight-man tag team match, where he, Mike Quackenbush, Love Bug and DJ Skittlez defeated Blind Rage, Eddie Kingston, BlackJack Marciano and Jigsaw, when Slayne pinned Rage. On December 7, 2002, Slayne and Blind Rage faced each other in a Mask vs. Hair match, which Rage managed to win and as a result Slayne was forced to unmask.\n\nTeam F.I.S.T. (2003\u20132004)\nSlayne returned to Chikara, without his mask and now using the ring name Icarus, on March 29, 2003, defeating his former stable mate and the reigning Young Lions Cup Champion Hallowicked in a non-title match. Icarus received his shot at the Young Lions Cup on April 12, but was unable to dethrone Hallowicked. On June 13 Icarus defeated Hallowicked in another non-title match, this time contested under Sudden Death rules. On July 5, 2003, Icarus entered the first ever Tag World Grand Prix with a new tag team partner, the masked Gran Akuma, using the tag team name Team F.I.S.T. (Friends in Similar Tights). After defeating The Conundrum (Jigsaw and Rorschach) in the first round of the tournament, Icarus and Akuma were eliminated from the tournament by Icarus' former stable mates Hallowicked and Blind Rage of the Night Shift, who would go on to win the entire tournament. After the tournament Team F.I.S.T. began feuding with the Wildcards (Eddie Kingston and BlackJack Marciano). 2003 ended with the Wildcards taking advantage of a hairline fracture in Akuma's ankle and defeating Team F.I.S.T. in a No Disqualification match on October 18. In 2004 the feud evolved with Jigsaw joining the Wildcards to form the Toxic Trio, which led to Mike Quackenbush coming to the aid of Team F.I.S.T. The feud came to an end on May 22, 2004, at Chikara's third anniversary show, when Icarus, Akuma and Quackenbush defeated the Toxic Trio in an Ultimate Jeopardy match and as a result both of the Wildcards were shaved bald.\n\nThe Kings of Wrestling (2005\u20132007)\nAfter a disappointing 2005 Tag World Grand Prix, where Team F.I.S.T. was eliminated in the second round and two draws and a loss against the tag team of Mister ZERO and Shane Storm, known collectively as Men@Work, Icarus and Akuma turned rudo by attacking Storm and ZERO after a match on May 20, 2005. The following day Chris Hero invited Icarus and Akuma to join him, Claudio Castagnoli and Arik Cannon in the stable known as The Kings of Wrestling. On July 22 Icarus entered the third Young Lions Cup tournament. After defeating Prophet in his first round match and Rorschach, Mickie Knuckles, Sabian, Arik Cannon and Ricky Reyes in the 6-way semifinal match, Icarus advanced to the finals of the tournament, where he was defeated by Shane Storm. On September 16 Icarus received a rematch for the Young Lions Cup, but was once again defeated by Storm. 2005 ended with Icarus witnessing at ringside how Storm defeated his tag team partner Gran Akuma in a Mask vs. Mask match.\n\nthumb|left|(Left to right) Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Gran Akuma of Team F.I.S.T.\nIn 2006, Icarus targeted Jigsaw and started going after his mask on multiple occasions, which led to Chikara Commissioner Bob Saget booking the two in a Hair vs. Mask match. On July 22, Jigsaw defeated Icarus and afterwards Jolly Roger and Mister ZERO, both of whom were in kayfabe forced to retire the previous year thanks to assaults from Icarus, returned to shave him bald. Icarus bounced back on October 28 by winning the third annual torneo cibernetico match. On November 12 Icarus and Akuma defeated the teams of Silver Bullet #1 and Silver Bullet #2, Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked) and Cheech and Cloudy in a one night tournament to earn the right to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas, held by their stablemates Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli. F.I.S.T. cashed in their title match at the following event on November 17 and defeated Hero and Castagnoli two falls to one to become the second ever Chikara Tag Team Champions. After the match, Icarus, Akuma and Hero kicked Castagnoli out of the Kings of Wrestling.\n\nthumb|Icarus in June 2008\n2007 began with Icarus and Akuma overthrowing Hero as the leader of the Kings of Wrestling, kicking him out of the stable and naming Chuck Taylor as their new third member. In February Icarus, Akuma and Taylor entered the first ever King of Trios tournament, where they made it all the way to the semifinals, before losing to the trio of KUDO, MIYAWAKI and Yoshiaki Yago, representing Kaientai Dojo. On May 27, 2007, at Chikara's fifth anniversary show, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor clashed heads with Chris Hero, Larry Sweeney and Claudio Castagnoli, who had been forced to re-join Hero after losing a match to him the previous month, over the rights to the name Kings of Wrestling. Icarus, Akuma and Taylor won the match, when Akuma pinned Sweeney, but after the match all six members decided to put their differences aside and united to re-form the Kings of Wrestling. During the rest of the year, the six were also joined by Mitch Ryder, Shayne Hawke and Max Boyer. F.I.S.T. then began a feud with Los Ice Creams (El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream Jr.), which culminated in the fourth torneo cibernetico match, where the Kings of Wrestling (Icarus, Ryder, Hero, Castagnoli, Sweeney, Akuma, Taylor and Hawke) faced Team Mega Mucha Lucha (Lince Dorado, Incognito, Magno, Equinox, El Hijo del Ice Cream, Ice Cream Jr., Chiva III and Chiva IV). The Kings of Wrestling easily defeated Team Mega Mucha Lucha, but in the end Castagnoli emerged as the sole winner of the match by defeating both Hero and Ryder and as a result won his freedom from the stable. The following month at Bruised Icarus and Chuck Taylor, who replaced the injured Gran Akuma in the title match, lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked), ending their reign at 343 days. The Kings of Wrestling disbanded in December, when Castagnoli defeated Hero in a feud ending match, after which Hero left the company and the rest of the Kings broke off into two separate trios; F.I.S.T. (Icarus, Akuma and Taylor) and the Fabulous Three (Sweeney, Ryder and Hawke).\n\nChikara's most dangerous trio (2008\u20132010)\nIn March 2008, F.I.S.T. entered the 2008 King of Trios, where they defeated Sweet 'n' Sour Inc. (Bobby Dempsey, Sara Del Rey and Tank Toland) and Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson), advancing to the quarterfinals of the tournament, before losing to The Colony (Fire Ant, Soldier Ant and Worker Ant). After defeating The Colony in a rematch during Chikara's sixth anniversary weekend, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor dubbed themselves \"Chikara's most dangerous trio\" and defeated trios like Sami Callihan, Steve Weiner and Ultimo Breakfast, Lince Dorado, Chiva II and Chiva III, Player Uno, Player Dos and Ultimo Breakfast and Lince Dorado, Angel de Fuego and Chiva II to prove their point.\n\nleft|thumb|Chuck Taylor and Icarus having their heads shaved after losing a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against The Colony\nOn February 20, 2009, F.I.S.T. squared off once more with The Colony, this time in a 2009 King of Trios qualifying match. F.I.S.T. won the match, when Icarus pinned Worker Ant. After the match Taylor planted Worker Ant on the floor of the arena with the Awful Waffle; in kayfabe this was used to explain Worker Ant's retirement from professional wrestling following the match. On March 27 F.I.S.T. entered their third King of Trios, defeating The Death Match Kings (Brain Damage, Necro Butcher and Toby Klein) in the first round of the tournament. After defeating The F1rst Family (Arik Cannon, Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz) in the quarter-finals, F.I.S.T. advanced to the semifinals of the tournament, where they would defeat the team of Equinox, Lince Dorado and Helios, the team known collectively as The Future is Now. On March 29, 2009, F.I.S.T. defeated Team Uppercut (Bryan Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli and Dave Taylor) in the finals, when Taylor forced Danielson to tap out, to win the 2009 King of Trios and solidify their spot as the top trio in Chikara. With the King of Trios over, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant of The Colony challenged F.I.S.T. to a match, in an attempt to avenge their fallen partner, but ended up once again being one upped, when Icarus and Taylor defeated them on April 25, following a low blow. After the match Chikara Director of Fun Leonard F. Chikarason booked the two teams to end their feud in a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match at Chikara's seventh anniversary show. On May 24, 2009, at Aniversario Yang F.I.S.T. ended their feud with The Colony, when Icarus and Taylor lost a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, and were both shaved bald.\n\nDuring the rest of 2009, Icarus and Akuma managed to pick up the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas, held by Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, and during Chikara's winter break announced that they would be cashing in their title match on January 30, 2010, at the season nine premiere, titled A Touch of Class. Icarus and Akuma would however be defeated in the title match two falls to one. On April 23 F.I.S.T. entered the 2010 King of Trios tournament, attempting to become the first two-time King of Trios winners. After defeating The Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield, Sugar Dunkerton and Matt Classic) in the first round, F.I.S.T. was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Tadasuke). During the tournament F.I.S.T. was observed by Johnny Gargano, a self-admitted fan of the team, who managed to stir up problems between its members by suggesting that the team had a weak link, which led to Taylor, who had been pinned in the match against Osaka Pro, pointing out Akuma and Akuma retaliating by claiming that Icarus was and always had been the weak link. On July 26 at Chikarasaurus Rex: King of Show, F.I.S.T. was defeated in a six-man tag team match by CIMA, Masaaki Mochizuki and Super Shenglong, when CIMA pinned Akuma. After the match Icarus and Taylor turned on Akuma, kicked him out of both F.I.S.T. and Chikara and gave his spot in the stable to Johnny Gargano.\n\nThe new F.I.S.T. (2010\u20132013)\nWith Gargano as a member, the new F.I.S.T. ended their losing streak by defeating Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson) and 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews) and Soldier Ant in six-man tag team matches on September 18 and 19. On September 28 UltraMantis Black announced that he had recruited Icarus to join his team of Chikara originals, consisting of both rudos and tecnicos, who would face the rudo stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes in the seventh annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. As a sign of unity between the Chikara originals, Icarus entered the match wearing his old Ichabod Slayne mask. He was eliminated from the match by BDK's Tim Donst. On April 15, 2011, F.I.S.T. entered the 2011 King of Trios, defeating Team Australia (Kabel, Percy T and Tama Williams) in their first round match. The following day F.I.S.T. defeated Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Ultimate Spider Jr.), avenging their loss from the previous year and advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. On April 17, F.I.S.T. scored a major upset in the semifinals of the King of Trios tournament by defeating Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki), when Icarus rolled up Sasuke for the win, after Taylor had blinded him with powder. Later that same day, F.I.S.T. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). In May, Icarus made his first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro Wrestling. In Chikara, Icarus started a rivalry with Gregory Iron, who defeated him in back-to-back matches on June 25 and September 18, leading Icarus to publicly accuse Iron of faking his cerebral palsy. On October 30, Icarus replaced stablemate Johnny Gargano, who was unable to attend an event due to traveling issues, and teamed with Chuck Taylor to successfully defend the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas against the Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield and Sugar Dunkerton). Icarus and Gregory Iron had what was billed as their final match against each other on November 13 at Chikara's first ever internet pay-per-view, High Noon, where Icarus was victorious following a low blow. Afterwards, Icarus was chased out of the ring by the returning Gran Akuma. On January 28, 2012, Icarus and Akuma had their first match against each other, which ended in a double countout. On February 25, Icarus again replaced an injured Gargano and teamed up with Taylor to successfully defend the Campeonatos de Parejas against the Spectral Envoy (Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black). On March 24, Icarus and Taylor lost the title to 3.0. On June 2 at Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, Icarus was defeated by Gran Akuma in a ladder match; as a result, Akuma earned a Chikara contract.\n\nOn August 2, Chikara's Director of Fun, Wink Vavasseur, named Sugar Dunkerton, who had announced his wish to join a stable, the fourth member of F.I.S.T. The other members, however, refused to accept Dunkerton as a full-fledged member, instead referring to him as their \"water boy\". On September 14, F.I.S.T., represented by Icarus, Gargano and Taylor, entered the 2012 King of Trios tournament, defeating Team Osaka Pro (Ebessan, Kikutaro and Takoyakida) in their first round match. The following day, F.I.S.T. defeated the all-female Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Kaori Yoneyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, F.I.S.T. was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by the Spectral Envoy (Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black), who went on to win the entire tournament.\n\nTecnico turn; Grand Champion (2013\u20132015)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in June 2015\nIn early 2013, Icarus began showing signs of a tecnico turn, when he started having problems with F.I.S.T. stablemates Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano. On May 3, Icarus turned on Gargano, hitting him with a spear, after Gargano had attacked Dunkerton, blaming him for a six-man tag team match loss against Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. The turn led to Gargano quitting F.I.S.T. The following day, Dunkerton also severed his ties with Icarus and F.I.S.T., when Icarus interfered in his match with Gran Akuma, causing a disqualification. On June 2 at Aniversario: Never Compromise, Icarus received his first shot at the Chikara Grand Championship, however, the match ended in a no contest, when the arena was attacked by a group known as \"Condor Security\" just as Icarus had Kingston locked in a submission hold. When Chikara went inactive following the event, Icarus began holding fan gatherings and spearheaded a petition for the return of the promotion. The storyline culminated on February 1, 2014, during the second National Pro Wrestling Day, when the Chikara roster defeated the Flood, a united group of rudos from Chikara's past, in a mass brawl, leading to Icarus announcing the promotion's return. On May 25 at Chikara's return event, You Only Live Twice, Icarus defeated Kingston in a rematch to become the second Chikara Grand Champion. Icarus made his first successful title defense on August 17 against Juan Francisco de Coronado. In September, Icarus teamed up with the reigning Campeones de Parejas Dasher Hatfield and Mark Angelosetti as the Golden Trio for the 2014 King of Trios. They made it all the way to the finals of the tournament, before losing to the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). On October 26, Icarus defeated Flood representative Jimmy Jacobs for his second successful defense of the Grand Championship. Chikara's 2014 season culminated with Tomorrow Never Dies, where Icarus defeated Flood leader Deucalion in the promotion's second ever steel cage match. At the next season premiere on January 25, 2015, Icarus made his third successful defense of the Grand Championship against former F.I.S.T. stablemate Chuck Taylor. His fourth defense took place on March 8, when he defeated N\u00f8kken. On April 6, during Chikara's tour of the United Kingdom, Icarus lost the Chikara Grand Championship to Hallowicked. Icarus received a rematch for the Grand Championship at the season 15 finale on December 5 in a three-way match also involving Eddie Kingston, but was defeated by Hallowicked.\n\nThe HeXed Men (2016)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in February 2016\nOn May 7, 2016, Icarus entered a storyline, where his mind was taken over by UltraMantis Black, adding him to a new rudo group which also included Frightmare, Hallowicked, Kodama and Obariyon. As part of the new group, Icarus became a servant of an entity known as \"Nazmaldun\" and was dubbed \"The Morning Star\". On September 2, Icarus entered the 2016 King of Trios representing the new group, alongside stablemates Hallowicked and Jigsaw. They defeated Bullet Ant, Missile Assault Man and Worker Ant in their first round match. The following day, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw defeated Major League Moustache (Dasher Hatfield, Trent Seven and Tyler Bate) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw were eliminated after being disqualified in their semifinal match against Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Hanako Nakamori and Manami Katsu). On December 3, The HeXed Men lost to Chikara's Mightiest Heroes in a Torneo Cibernetico match. After the match, Ophidian took the Eye Of Tyr from UltraMantis Black, and only some of the HeXed Men were free from the spell.\n\nLater career (2017\u20132020)\nSince 2017, Icarus has been in some various storylines until Chikara close down in June 2020.\n\nDragon Gate USA and Evolve (2009\u20132010)\nOn July 25, 2009, Icarus appeared on Dragon Gate USA's first pay-per-view Enter the Dragon in an eight-man tag team Chikara showcase match, where he, Gran Akuma, Amasis and Hallowicked were defeated by Mike Quackenbush, Jigsaw, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant.\n\nOn January 16, 2010, Icarus made his debut for Evolve Wrestling, at the promotion's first ever show, teaming with Gran Akuma and Brodie Lee as Akuma's Army, in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Hallowicked, Frightmare and Mike Quackenbush.\n\nIndependent circuit (2020\u2013present)\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nthumb|Icarus as one-half of Chikara's Campeones de Parejas\nChikara\nChikara Campeonatos de Parejas (1 time) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nChikara Grand Championship (1 time)\nKing of Trios (2009) \u2013 with Chuck Taylor and Gran Akuma\nOne Night Tag Team Tournament (2006)\nTorneo Cibernetico (2006)\n #1 Contendership Tag Team Tournament (2006) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nExcellence Professional Wrestling\nExcellence Championship (1 time)\nCATender Tournament (2018)\nPro Wrestling Entertainment\nPWE Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPWE Tag Team Championship Tournament (2005) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nPWI ranked him #220 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2010\n\nLuchas de Apuestas record\n\nWinner (wager)Loser (wager)LocationEventDateNotesBlind Rage (hair)  Ichabod Slayne (mask)  Allentown, Pennsylvania  Season 1 Finale    Jigsaw (mask)  Icarus (hair)  Hellertown, Pennsylvania  The Crushing Weight of Mainstream Ignorance    Fire Ant and Soldier Ant (masks)  Icarus and Chuck Taylor (hairs)  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Aniversario Yang    \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOnline World of Wrestling profile\n\nCategory:1982 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American male professional wrestlers\nCategory:Masked wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century male professional wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century American professional wrestlers\nCategory:Professional wrestlers from Pennsylvania",

        "text": "Ronald Grams (born July 26, 1982) is an American professional wrestler. He is known for his 18-year tenure with the Chikara professional wrestling promotion, under the name Icarus since 2002, where he is a former Grand Champion, Campeon de Parejas and King of Trios winner. He has also wrestled for Combat Zone Wrestling, Dragon Gate USA, Evolve Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nGrams received his initial training from Chikara founders Mike Quackenbush and Reckless Youth at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, where he was trained on the first term of the school alongside the likes of Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. Grams and Hallowicked were childhood friends and entered the school with the intention of becoming a tag team.\n\nChikara\nNight Shift (2002)\nGrams made his professional wrestling debut on May 25, 2002, at Chikara's first ever show as Ichabod Slayne, a masked member of the rudo (bad guy) stable Night Shift, with partners Blind Rage and Hallowicked. In their first professional wrestling match, Slayne and Hallowicked were defeated by Beauty and the Beast (Marshal Law and Love Bug) in a tag team match. When Hallowicked began gaining success as a singles wrestler, Slayne and Blind Rage were left to represent Night Shift in the company's tag team division. However, it wasn't long before problems rose between the two, culminating on June 28, 2002, in a ten-man tag team match, where Blind Rage's misstep caused Slayne to be pinned and as a result he was forced to wear a dress. On November 16 Slayne surprised his tag team partner by appearing as a member of the opposing tecnico (good guy) team in an eight-man tag team match, where he, Mike Quackenbush, Love Bug and DJ Skittlez defeated Blind Rage, Eddie Kingston, BlackJack Marciano and Jigsaw, when Slayne pinned Rage. On December 7, 2002, Slayne and Blind Rage faced each other in a Mask vs. Hair match, which Rage managed to win and as a result Slayne was forced to unmask.\n\nTeam F.I.S.T. (2003\u20132004)\nSlayne returned to Chikara, without his mask and now using the ring name Icarus, on March 29, 2003, defeating his former stable mate and the reigning Young Lions Cup Champion Hallowicked in a non-title match. Icarus received his shot at the Young Lions Cup on April 12, but was unable to dethrone Hallowicked. On June 13 Icarus defeated Hallowicked in another non-title match, this time contested under Sudden Death rules. On July 5, 2003, Icarus entered the first ever Tag World Grand Prix with a new tag team partner, the masked Gran Akuma, using the tag team name Team F.I.S.T. (Friends in Similar Tights). After defeating The Conundrum (Jigsaw and Rorschach) in the first round of the tournament, Icarus and Akuma were eliminated from the tournament by Icarus' former stable mates Hallowicked and Blind Rage of the Night Shift, who would go on to win the entire tournament. After the tournament Team F.I.S.T. began feuding with the Wildcards (Eddie Kingston and BlackJack Marciano). 2003 ended with the Wildcards taking advantage of a hairline fracture in Akuma's ankle and defeating Team F.I.S.T. in a No Disqualification match on October 18. In 2004 the feud evolved with Jigsaw joining the Wildcards to form the Toxic Trio, which led to Mike Quackenbush coming to the aid of Team F.I.S.T. The feud came to an end on May 22, 2004, at Chikara's third anniversary show, when Icarus, Akuma and Quackenbush defeated the Toxic Trio in an Ultimate Jeopardy match and as a result both of the Wildcards were shaved bald.\n\nThe Kings of Wrestling (2005\u20132007)\nAfter a disappointing 2005 Tag World Grand Prix, where Team F.I.S.T. was eliminated in the second round and two draws and a loss against the tag team of Mister ZERO and Shane Storm, known collectively as Men@Work, Icarus and Akuma turned rudo by attacking Storm and ZERO after a match on May 20, 2005. The following day Chris Hero invited Icarus and Akuma to join him, Claudio Castagnoli and Arik Cannon in the stable known as The Kings of Wrestling. On July 22 Icarus entered the third Young Lions Cup tournament. After defeating Prophet in his first round match and Rorschach, Mickie Knuckles, Sabian, Arik Cannon and Ricky Reyes in the 6-way semifinal match, Icarus advanced to the finals of the tournament, where he was defeated by Shane Storm. On September 16 Icarus received a rematch for the Young Lions Cup, but was once again defeated by Storm. 2005 ended with Icarus witnessing at ringside how Storm defeated his tag team partner Gran Akuma in a Mask vs. Mask match.\n\nthumb|left|(Left to right) Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Gran Akuma of Team F.I.S.T.\nIn 2006, Icarus targeted Jigsaw and started going after his mask on multiple occasions, which led to Chikara Commissioner Bob Saget booking the two in a Hair vs. Mask match. On July 22, Jigsaw defeated Icarus and afterwards Jolly Roger and Mister ZERO, both of whom were in kayfabe forced to retire the previous year thanks to assaults from Icarus, returned to shave him bald. Icarus bounced back on October 28 by winning the third annual torneo cibernetico match. On November 12 Icarus and Akuma defeated the teams of Silver Bullet #1 and Silver Bullet #2, Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked) and Cheech and Cloudy in a one night tournament to earn the right to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas, held by their stablemates Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli. F.I.S.T. cashed in their title match at the following event on November 17 and defeated Hero and Castagnoli two falls to one to become the second ever Chikara Tag Team Champions. After the match, Icarus, Akuma and Hero kicked Castagnoli out of the Kings of Wrestling.\n\nthumb|Icarus in June 2008\n2007 began with Icarus and Akuma overthrowing Hero as the leader of the Kings of Wrestling, kicking him out of the stable and naming Chuck Taylor as their new third member. In February Icarus, Akuma and Taylor entered the first ever King of Trios tournament, where they made it all the way to the semifinals, before losing to the trio of KUDO, MIYAWAKI and Yoshiaki Yago, representing Kaientai Dojo. On May 27, 2007, at Chikara's fifth anniversary show, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor clashed heads with Chris Hero, Larry Sweeney and Claudio Castagnoli, who had been forced to re-join Hero after losing a match to him the previous month, over the rights to the name Kings of Wrestling. Icarus, Akuma and Taylor won the match, when Akuma pinned Sweeney, but after the match all six members decided to put their differences aside and united to re-form the Kings of Wrestling. During the rest of the year, the six were also joined by Mitch Ryder, Shayne Hawke and Max Boyer. F.I.S.T. then began a feud with Los Ice Creams (El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream Jr.), which culminated in the fourth torneo cibernetico match, where the Kings of Wrestling (Icarus, Ryder, Hero, Castagnoli, Sweeney, Akuma, Taylor and Hawke) faced Team Mega Mucha Lucha (Lince Dorado, Incognito, Magno, Equinox, El Hijo del Ice Cream, Ice Cream Jr., Chiva III and Chiva IV). The Kings of Wrestling easily defeated Team Mega Mucha Lucha, but in the end Castagnoli emerged as the sole winner of the match by defeating both Hero and Ryder and as a result won his freedom from the stable. The following month at Bruised Icarus and Chuck Taylor, who replaced the injured Gran Akuma in the title match, lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked), ending their reign at 343 days. The Kings of Wrestling disbanded in December, when Castagnoli defeated Hero in a feud ending match, after which Hero left the company and the rest of the Kings broke off into two separate trios; F.I.S.T. (Icarus, Akuma and Taylor) and the Fabulous Three (Sweeney, Ryder and Hawke).\n\nChikara's most dangerous trio (2008\u20132010)\nIn March 2008, F.I.S.T. entered the 2008 King of Trios, where they defeated Sweet 'n' Sour Inc. (Bobby Dempsey, Sara Del Rey and Tank Toland) and Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson), advancing to the quarterfinals of the tournament, before losing to The Colony (Fire Ant, Soldier Ant and Worker Ant). After defeating The Colony in a rematch during Chikara's sixth anniversary weekend, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor dubbed themselves \"Chikara's most dangerous trio\" and defeated trios like Sami Callihan, Steve Weiner and Ultimo Breakfast, Lince Dorado, Chiva II and Chiva III, Player Uno, Player Dos and Ultimo Breakfast and Lince Dorado, Angel de Fuego and Chiva II to prove their point.\n\nleft|thumb|Chuck Taylor and Icarus having their heads shaved after losing a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against The Colony\nOn February 20, 2009, F.I.S.T. squared off once more with The Colony, this time in a 2009 King of Trios qualifying match. F.I.S.T. won the match, when Icarus pinned Worker Ant. After the match Taylor planted Worker Ant on the floor of the arena with the Awful Waffle; in kayfabe this was used to explain Worker Ant's retirement from professional wrestling following the match. On March 27 F.I.S.T. entered their third King of Trios, defeating The Death Match Kings (Brain Damage, Necro Butcher and Toby Klein) in the first round of the tournament. After defeating The F1rst Family (Arik Cannon, Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz) in the quarter-finals, F.I.S.T. advanced to the semifinals of the tournament, where they would defeat the team of Equinox, Lince Dorado and Helios, the team known collectively as The Future is Now. On March 29, 2009, F.I.S.T. defeated Team Uppercut (Bryan Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli and Dave Taylor) in the finals, when Taylor forced Danielson to tap out, to win the 2009 King of Trios and solidify their spot as the top trio in Chikara. With the King of Trios over, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant of The Colony challenged F.I.S.T. to a match, in an attempt to avenge their fallen partner, but ended up once again being one upped, when Icarus and Taylor defeated them on April 25, following a low blow. After the match Chikara Director of Fun Leonard F. Chikarason booked the two teams to end their feud in a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match at Chikara's seventh anniversary show. On May 24, 2009, at Aniversario Yang F.I.S.T. ended their feud with The Colony, when Icarus and Taylor lost a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, and were both shaved bald.\n\nDuring the rest of 2009, Icarus and Akuma managed to pick up the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas, held by Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, and during Chikara's winter break announced that they would be cashing in their title match on January 30, 2010, at the season nine premiere, titled A Touch of Class. Icarus and Akuma would however be defeated in the title match two falls to one. On April 23 F.I.S.T. entered the 2010 King of Trios tournament, attempting to become the first two-time King of Trios winners. After defeating The Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield, Sugar Dunkerton and Matt Classic) in the first round, F.I.S.T. was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Tadasuke). During the tournament F.I.S.T. was observed by Johnny Gargano, a self-admitted fan of the team, who managed to stir up problems between its members by suggesting that the team had a weak link, which led to Taylor, who had been pinned in the match against Osaka Pro, pointing out Akuma and Akuma retaliating by claiming that Icarus was and always had been the weak link. On July 26 at Chikarasaurus Rex: King of Show, F.I.S.T. was defeated in a six-man tag team match by CIMA, Masaaki Mochizuki and Super Shenglong, when CIMA pinned Akuma. After the match Icarus and Taylor turned on Akuma, kicked him out of both F.I.S.T. and Chikara and gave his spot in the stable to Johnny Gargano.\n\nThe new F.I.S.T. (2010\u20132013)\nWith Gargano as a member, the new F.I.S.T. ended their losing streak by defeating Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson) and 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews) and Soldier Ant in six-man tag team matches on September 18 and 19. On September 28 UltraMantis Black announced that he had recruited Icarus to join his team of Chikara originals, consisting of both rudos and tecnicos, who would face the rudo stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes in the seventh annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. As a sign of unity between the Chikara originals, Icarus entered the match wearing his old Ichabod Slayne mask. He was eliminated from the match by BDK's Tim Donst. On April 15, 2011, F.I.S.T. entered the 2011 King of Trios, defeating Team Australia (Kabel, Percy T and Tama Williams) in their first round match. The following day F.I.S.T. defeated Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Ultimate Spider Jr.), avenging their loss from the previous year and advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. On April 17, F.I.S.T. scored a major upset in the semifinals of the King of Trios tournament by defeating Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki), when Icarus rolled up Sasuke for the win, after Taylor had blinded him with powder. Later that same day, F.I.S.T. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). In May, Icarus made his first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro Wrestling. In Chikara, Icarus started a rivalry with Gregory Iron, who defeated him in back-to-back matches on June 25 and September 18, leading Icarus to publicly accuse Iron of faking his cerebral palsy. On October 30, Icarus replaced stablemate Johnny Gargano, who was unable to attend an event due to traveling issues, and teamed with Chuck Taylor to successfully defend the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas against the Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield and Sugar Dunkerton). Icarus and Gregory Iron had what was billed as their final match against each other on November 13 at Chikara's first ever internet pay-per-view, High Noon, where Icarus was victorious following a low blow. Afterwards, Icarus was chased out of the ring by the returning Gran Akuma. On January 28, 2012, Icarus and Akuma had their first match against each other, which ended in a double countout. On February 25, Icarus again replaced an injured Gargano and teamed up with Taylor to successfully defend the Campeonatos de Parejas against the Spectral Envoy (Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black). On March 24, Icarus and Taylor lost the title to 3.0. On June 2 at Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, Icarus was defeated by Gran Akuma in a ladder match; as a result, Akuma earned a Chikara contract.\n\nOn August 2, Chikara's Director of Fun, Wink Vavasseur, named Sugar Dunkerton, who had announced his wish to join a stable, the fourth member of F.I.S.T. The other members, however, refused to accept Dunkerton as a full-fledged member, instead referring to him as their \"water boy\". On September 14, F.I.S.T., represented by Icarus, Gargano and Taylor, entered the 2012 King of Trios tournament, defeating Team Osaka Pro (Ebessan, Kikutaro and Takoyakida) in their first round match. The following day, F.I.S.T. defeated the all-female Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Kaori Yoneyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, F.I.S.T. was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by the Spectral Envoy (Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black), who went on to win the entire tournament.\n\nTecnico turn; Grand Champion (2013\u20132015)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in June 2015\nIn early 2013, Icarus began showing signs of a tecnico turn, when he started having problems with F.I.S.T. stablemates Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano. On May 3, Icarus turned on Gargano, hitting him with a spear, after Gargano had attacked Dunkerton, blaming him for a six-man tag team match loss against Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. The turn led to Gargano quitting F.I.S.T. The following day, Dunkerton also severed his ties with Icarus and F.I.S.T., when Icarus interfered in his match with Gran Akuma, causing a disqualification. On June 2 at Aniversario: Never Compromise, Icarus received his first shot at the Chikara Grand Championship, however, the match ended in a no contest, when the arena was attacked by a group known as \"Condor Security\" just as Icarus had Kingston locked in a submission hold. When Chikara went inactive following the event, Icarus began holding fan gatherings and spearheaded a petition for the return of the promotion. The storyline culminated on February 1, 2014, during the second National Pro Wrestling Day, when the Chikara roster defeated the Flood, a united group of rudos from Chikara's past, in a mass brawl, leading to Icarus announcing the promotion's return. On May 25 at Chikara's return event, You Only Live Twice, Icarus defeated Kingston in a rematch to become the second Chikara Grand Champion. Icarus made his first successful title defense on August 17 against Juan Francisco de Coronado. In September, Icarus teamed up with the reigning Campeones de Parejas Dasher Hatfield and Mark Angelosetti as the Golden Trio for the 2014 King of Trios. They made it all the way to the finals of the tournament, before losing to the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). On October 26, Icarus defeated Flood representative Jimmy Jacobs for his second successful defense of the Grand Championship. Chikara's 2014 season culminated with Tomorrow Never Dies, where Icarus defeated Flood leader Deucalion in the promotion's second ever steel cage match. At the next season premiere on January 25, 2015, Icarus made his third successful defense of the Grand Championship against former F.I.S.T. stablemate Chuck Taylor. His fourth defense took place on March 8, when he defeated N\u00f8kken. On April 6, during Chikara's tour of the United Kingdom, Icarus lost the Chikara Grand Championship to Hallowicked. Icarus received a rematch for the Grand Championship at the season 15 finale on December 5 in a three-way match also involving Eddie Kingston, but was defeated by Hallowicked.\n\nThe HeXed Men (2016)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in February 2016\nOn May 7, 2016, Icarus entered a storyline, where his mind was taken over by UltraMantis Black, adding him to a new rudo group which also included Frightmare, Hallowicked, Kodama and Obariyon. As part of the new group, Icarus became a servant of an entity known as \"Nazmaldun\" and was dubbed \"The Morning Star\". On September 2, Icarus entered the 2016 King of Trios representing the new group, alongside stablemates Hallowicked and Jigsaw. They defeated Bullet Ant, Missile Assault Man and Worker Ant in their first round match. The following day, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw defeated Major League Moustache (Dasher Hatfield, Trent Seven and Tyler Bate) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw were eliminated after being disqualified in their semifinal match against Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Hanako Nakamori and Manami Katsu). On December 3, The HeXed Men lost to Chikara's Mightiest Heroes in a Torneo Cibernetico match. After the match, Ophidian took the Eye Of Tyr from UltraMantis Black, and only some of the HeXed Men were free from the spell.\n\nLater career (2017\u20132020)\nSince 2017, Icarus has been in some various storylines until Chikara close down in June 2020.\n\nDragon Gate USA and Evolve (2009\u20132010)\nOn July 25, 2009, Icarus appeared on Dragon Gate USA's first pay-per-view Enter the Dragon in an eight-man tag team Chikara showcase match, where he, Gran Akuma, Amasis and Hallowicked were defeated by Mike Quackenbush, Jigsaw, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant.\n\nOn January 16, 2010, Icarus made his debut for Evolve Wrestling, at the promotion's first ever show, teaming with Gran Akuma and Brodie Lee as Akuma's Army, in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Hallowicked, Frightmare and Mike Quackenbush.\n\nIndependent circuit (2020\u2013present)\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nthumb|Icarus as one-half of Chikara's Campeones de Parejas\nChikara\nChikara Campeonatos de Parejas (1 time) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nChikara Grand Championship (1 time)\nKing of Trios (2009) \u2013 with Chuck Taylor and Gran Akuma\nOne Night Tag Team Tournament (2006)\nTorneo Cibernetico (2006)\n #1 Contendership Tag Team Tournament (2006) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nExcellence Professional Wrestling\nExcellence Championship (1 time)\nCATender Tournament (2018)\nPro Wrestling Entertainment\nPWE Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPWE Tag Team Championship Tournament (2005) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nPWI ranked him #220 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2010\n\nLuchas de Apuestas record\n\nWinner (wager)Loser (wager)LocationEventDateNotesBlind Rage (hair)  Ichabod Slayne (mask)  Allentown, Pennsylvania  Season 1 Finale    Jigsaw (mask)  Icarus (hair)  Hellertown, Pennsylvania  The Crushing Weight of Mainstream Ignorance    Fire Ant and Soldier Ant (masks)  Icarus and Chuck Taylor (hairs)  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Aniversario Yang    \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOnline World of Wrestling profile\n\nCategory:1982 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American male professional wrestlers\nCategory:Masked wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century male professional wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century American professional wrestlers\nCategory:Professional wrestlers from Pennsylvania",

After the match, Icarus, Akuma and Hero kicked Castagnoli out of the Kings of Wrestling.\n\nthumb|Icarus in June 2008\n2007 began with Icarus and Akuma overthrowing Hero as the leader of the Kings of Wrestling, kicking him out of the stable and naming Chuck Taylor as their new third member. In February Icarus, Akuma and Taylor entered the first ever King of Trios tournament, where they made it all the way to the semifinals, before losing to the trio of KUDO, MIYAWAKI and Yoshiaki Yago, representing Kaientai Dojo. On May 27, 2007, at Chikara's fifth anniversary show, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor clashed heads with Chris Hero, Larry Sweeney and Claudio Castagnoli, who had been forced to re-join Hero after losing a match to him the previous month, over the rights to the name Kings of Wrestling. Icarus, Akuma and Taylor won the match, when Akuma pinned Sweeney, but after the match all six members decided to put their differences aside and united to re-form the Kings of Wrestling. During the rest of the year, the six were also joined by Mitch Ryder, Shayne Hawke and Max Boyer. F.I.S.T. then began a feud with Los Ice Creams (El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream Jr.), which culminated in the fourth torneo cibernetico match, where the Kings of Wrestling (Icarus, Ryder, Hero, Castagnoli, Sweeney, Akuma, Taylor and Hawke) faced Team Mega Mucha Lucha (Lince Dorado, Incognito, Magno, Equinox, El Hijo del Ice Cream, Ice Cream Jr., Chiva III and Chiva IV).

The following month at Bruised Icarus and Chuck Taylor, who replaced the injured Gran Akuma in the title match, lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked), ending their reign at 343 days. The Kings of Wrestling disbanded in December, when Castagnoli defeated Hero in a feud ending match, after which Hero left the company and the rest of the Kings broke off into two separate trios; F.I.S.T. (Icarus, Akuma and Taylor) and the Fabulous Three (Sweeney, Ryder and Hawke).\n\nChikara's most dangerous trio (2008\u20132010)\nIn March 2008, F.I.S.T. entered the 2008 King of Trios, where they defeated Sweet 'n' Sour Inc. (Bobby Dempsey, Sara Del Rey and Tank Toland) and Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson), advancing to the quarterfinals of the tournament, before losing to The Colony (Fire Ant, Soldier Ant and Worker Ant). After defeating The Colony in a rematch during Chikara's sixth anniversary weekend, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor dubbed themselves \"Chikara's most dangerous trio\" and defeated trios like Sami Callihan, Steve Weiner and Ultimo Breakfast, Lince Dorado, Chiva II and Chiva III, Player Uno, Player Dos and Ultimo Breakfast and Lince Dorado, Angel de Fuego and Chiva II to prove their point.\n\nleft|thumb|Chuck Taylor and Icarus having their heads shaved after losing a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against The Colony\nOn February 20, 2009, F.I.S.T. squared off once more with The Colony, this time in a 2009 King of Trios qualifying match. F.I.S.T. won the match, when Icarus pinned Worker Ant. After the match Taylor planted Worker Ant on the floor of the arena with the Awful Waffle; in kayfabe this was used to explain Worker Ant's retirement from professional wrestling following the match. On March 27 F.I.S.T. entered their third King of Trios, defeating The Death Match Kings (Brain Damage, Necro Butcher and Toby Klein) in the first round of the tournament. After defeating The F1rst Family (Arik Cannon, Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz) in the quarter-finals, F.I.S.T. advanced to the semifinals of the tournament, where they would defeat the team of Equinox, Lince Dorado and Helios, the team known collectively as The Future is Now. On March 29, 2009, F.I.S.T. defeated Team Uppercut (Bryan Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli and Dave Taylor) in the finals, when Taylor forced Danielson to tap out, to win the 2009 King of Trios and solidify their spot as the top trio in Chikara. With the King of Trios over, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant of The Colony challenged F.I.S.T. to a match, in an attempt to avenge their fallen partner, but ended up once again being one upped, when Icarus and Taylor defeated them on April 25, following a low blow. After the match Chikara Director of Fun Leonard F. Chikarason booked the two teams to end their feud in a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match at Chikara's seventh anniversary show. On May 24, 2009, at Aniversario Yang F.I.S.T. ended their feud with The Colony, when Icarus and Taylor lost a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, and were both shaved bald.\n\nDuring the rest of 2009, Icarus and Akuma managed to pick up the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas, held by Fire Ant and Soldier Ant, and during Chikara's winter break announced that they would be cashing in their title match on January 30, 2010, at the season nine premiere, titled A Touch of Class.

After defeating The Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield, Sugar Dunkerton and Matt Classic) in the first round, F.I.S.T. was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Tadasuke). During the tournament F.I.S.T. was observed by Johnny Gargano, a self-admitted fan of the team, who managed to stir up problems between its members by suggesting that the team had a weak link, which led to Taylor, who had been pinned in the match against Osaka Pro, pointing out Akuma and Akuma retaliating by claiming that Icarus was and always had been the weak link. On July 26 at Chikarasaurus Rex: King of Show, F.I.S.T. was defeated in a six-man tag team match by CIMA, Masaaki Mochizuki and Super Shenglong, when CIMA pinned Akuma. After the match Icarus and Taylor turned on Akuma, kicked him out of both F.I.S.T. and Chikara and gave his spot in the stable to Johnny Gargano.\n\nThe new F.I.S.T. (2010\u20132013)\nWith Gargano as a member, the new F.I.S.T. ended their losing streak by defeating Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson) and 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews) and Soldier Ant in six-man tag team matches on September 18 and 19. On September 28 UltraMantis Black announced that he had recruited Icarus to join his team of Chikara originals, consisting of both rudos and tecnicos, who would face the rudo stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes in the seventh annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. As a sign of unity between the Chikara originals, Icarus entered the match wearing his old Ichabod Slayne mask. He was eliminated from the match by BDK's Tim Donst. On April 15, 2011, F.I.S.T. entered the 2011 King of Trios, defeating Team Australia (Kabel, Percy T and Tama Williams) in their first round match.

On April 17, F.I.S.T. scored a major upset in the semifinals of the King of Trios tournament by defeating Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki), when Icarus rolled up Sasuke for the win, after Taylor had blinded him with powder. Later that same day, F.I.S.T. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). In May, Icarus made his first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro Wrestling. In Chikara, Icarus started a rivalry with Gregory Iron, who defeated him in back-to-back matches on June 25 and September 18, leading Icarus to publicly accuse Iron of faking his cerebral palsy. On October 30, Icarus replaced stablemate Johnny Gargano, who was unable to attend an event due to traveling issues, and teamed with Chuck Taylor to successfully defend the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas against the Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield and Sugar Dunkerton). Icarus and Gregory Iron had what was billed as their final match against each other on November 13 at Chikara's first ever internet pay-per-view, High Noon, where Icarus was victorious following a low blow. Afterwards, Icarus was chased out of the ring by the returning Gran Akuma. On January 28, 2012, Icarus and Akuma had their first match against each other, which ended in a double countout. On February 25, Icarus again replaced an injured Gargano and teamed up with Taylor to successfully defend the Campeonatos de Parejas against the Spectral Envoy (Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black). On March 24, Icarus and Taylor lost the title to 3.0. On June 2 at Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, Icarus was defeated by Gran Akuma in a ladder match; as a result, Akuma earned a Chikara contract.\n\nOn August 2, Chikara's Director of Fun, Wink Vavasseur, named Sugar Dunkerton, who had announced his wish to join a stable, the fourth member of F.I.S.T. The other members, however, refused to accept Dunkerton as a full-fledged member, instead referring to him as their \"water boy\". On September 14, F.I.S.T., represented by Icarus, Gargano and Taylor, entered the 2012 King of Trios tournament, defeating Team Osaka Pro (Ebessan, Kikutaro and Takoyakida) in their first round match. The following day, F.I.S.T. defeated the all-female Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Kaori Yoneyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, F.I.S.T. was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by the Spectral Envoy (Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black), who went on to win the entire tournament.\n\nTecnico turn; Grand Champion (2013\u20132015)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in June 2015\nIn early 2013, Icarus began showing signs of a tecnico turn, when he started having problems with F.I.S.T. stablemates Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano. On May 3, Icarus turned on Gargano, hitting him with a spear, after Gargano had attacked Dunkerton, blaming him for a six-man tag team match loss against Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. The turn led to Gargano quitting F.I.S.T. The following day, Dunkerton also severed his ties with Icarus and F.I.S.T., when Icarus interfered in his match with Gran Akuma, causing a disqualification. On June 2 at Aniversario: Never Compromise, Icarus received his first shot at the Chikara Grand Championship, however, the match ended in a no contest, when the arena was attacked by a group known as \"Condor Security\" just as Icarus had Kingston locked in a submission hold. When Chikara went inactive following the event, Icarus began holding fan gatherings and spearheaded a petition for the return of the promotion. The storyline culminated on February 1, 2014, during the second National Pro Wrestling Day, when the Chikara roster defeated the Flood, a united group of rudos from Chikara's past, in a mass brawl, leading to Icarus announcing the promotion's return. On May 25 at Chikara's return event, You Only Live Twice, Icarus defeated Kingston in a rematch to become the second Chikara Grand Champion. Icarus made his first successful title defense on August 17 against Juan Francisco de Coronado.

They made it all the way to the finals of the tournament, before losing to the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). On October 26, Icarus defeated Flood representative Jimmy Jacobs for his second successful defense of the Grand Championship. Chikara's 2014 season culminated with Tomorrow Never Dies, where Icarus defeated Flood leader Deucalion in the promotion's second ever steel cage match. At the next season premiere on January 25, 2015, Icarus made his third successful defense of the Grand Championship against former F.I.S.T. stablemate Chuck Taylor. His fourth defense took place on March 8, when he defeated N\u00f8kken. On April 6, during Chikara's tour of the United Kingdom, Icarus lost the Chikara Grand Championship to Hallowicked. Icarus received a rematch for the Grand Championship at the season 15 finale on December 5 in a three-way match also involving Eddie Kingston, but was defeated by Hallowicked.\n\nThe HeXed Men (2016)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in February 2016\nOn May 7, 2016, Icarus entered a storyline, where his mind was taken over by UltraMantis Black, adding him to a new rudo group which also included Frightmare, Hallowicked, Kodama and Obariyon. As part of the new group, Icarus became a servant of an entity known as \"Nazmaldun\" and was dubbed \"The Morning Star\". On September 2, Icarus entered the 2016 King of Trios representing the new group, alongside stablemates Hallowicked and Jigsaw. They defeated Bullet Ant, Missile Assault Man and Worker Ant in their first round match. The following day, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw defeated Major League Moustache (Dasher Hatfield, Trent Seven and Tyler Bate) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw were eliminated after being disqualified in their semifinal match against Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Hanako Nakamori and Manami Katsu). On December 3, The HeXed Men lost to Chikara's Mightiest Heroes in a Torneo Cibernetico match. After the match, Ophidian took the Eye Of Tyr from UltraMantis Black, and only some of the HeXed Men were free from the spell.\n\nLater career (2017\u20132020)\nSince 2017, Icarus has been in some various storylines until Chikara close down in June 2020.\n\nDragon Gate USA and Evolve (2009\u20132010)\nOn July 25, 2009, Icarus appeared on Dragon Gate USA's first pay-per-view Enter the Dragon in an eight-man tag team Chikara showcase match, where he, Gran Akuma, Amasis and Hallowicked were defeated by Mike Quackenbush, Jigsaw, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant.\n\nOn January 16, 2010, Icarus made his debut for Evolve Wrestling, at the promotion's first ever show, teaming with Gran Akuma and Brodie Lee as Akuma's Army, in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Hallowicked, Frightmare and Mike Quackenbush.\n\nIndependent circuit (2020\u2013present)\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nthumb|Icarus as one-half of Chikara's Campeones de Parejas\nChikara\nChikara Campeonatos de Parejas (1 time) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nChikara Grand Championship (1 time)\nKing of Trios (2009) \u2013 with Chuck Taylor and Gran Akuma\nOne Night Tag Team Tournament (2006)\nTorneo Cibernetico (2006)\n #1 Contendership Tag Team Tournament (2006) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nExcellence Professional Wrestling\nExcellence Championship (1 time)\nCATender Tournament (2018)\nPro Wrestling Entertainment\nPWE Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPWE Tag Team Championship Tournament (2005) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nPWI ranked him #220 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2010\n\nLuchas de Apuestas record\n\nWinner (wager)Loser (wager)LocationEventDateNotesBlind Rage (hair)  Ichabod Slayne (mask)  Allentown, Pennsylvania  Season 1 Finale    Jigsaw (mask)  Icarus (hair)  Hellertown, Pennsylvania  The Crushing Weight of Mainstream Ignorance    Fire Ant and Soldier Ant (masks)  Icarus and Chuck Taylor (hairs)  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Aniversario Yang    \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOnline World of Wrestling profile\n\nCategory:1982 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American male professional wrestlers\nCategory:Masked wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century male professional wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century American professional wrestlers\nCategory:Professional wrestlers from Pennsylvania",

        "text": "Ronald Grams (born July 26, 1982) is an American professional wrestler. He is known for his 18-year tenure with the Chikara professional wrestling promotion, under the name Icarus since 2002, where he is a former Grand Champion, Campeon de Parejas and King of Trios winner. He has also wrestled for Combat Zone Wrestling, Dragon Gate USA, Evolve Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nGrams received his initial training from Chikara founders Mike Quackenbush and Reckless Youth at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, where he was trained on the first term of the school alongside the likes of Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. Grams and Hallowicked were childhood friends and entered the school with the intention of becoming a tag team.\n\nChikara\nNight Shift (2002)\nGrams made his professional wrestling debut on May 25, 2002, at Chikara's first ever show as Ichabod Slayne, a masked member of the rudo (bad guy) stable Night Shift, with partners Blind Rage and Hallowicked. In their first professional wrestling match, Slayne and Hallowicked were defeated by Beauty and the Beast (Marshal Law and Love Bug) in a tag team match. When Hallowicked began gaining success as a singles wrestler, Slayne and Blind Rage were left to represent Night Shift in the company's tag team division. However, it wasn't long before problems rose between the two, culminating on June 28, 2002, in a ten-man tag team match, where Blind Rage's misstep caused Slayne to be pinned and as a result he was forced to wear a dress. On November 16 Slayne surprised his tag team partner by appearing as a member of the opposing tecnico (good guy) team in an eight-man tag team match, where he, Mike Quackenbush, Love Bug and DJ Skittlez defeated Blind Rage, Eddie Kingston, BlackJack Marciano and Jigsaw, when Slayne pinned Rage. On December 7, 2002, Slayne and Blind Rage faced each other in a Mask vs. Hair match, which Rage managed to win and as a result Slayne was forced to unmask.\n\nTeam F.I.S.T. (2003\u20132004)\nSlayne returned to Chikara, without his mask and now using the ring name Icarus, on March 29, 2003, defeating his former stable mate and the reigning Young Lions Cup Champion Hallowicked in a non-title match. Icarus received his shot at the Young Lions Cup on April 12, but was unable to dethrone Hallowicked. On June 13 Icarus defeated Hallowicked in another non-title match, this time contested under Sudden Death rules. On July 5, 2003, Icarus entered the first ever Tag World Grand Prix with a new tag team partner, the masked Gran Akuma, using the tag team name Team F.I.S.T. (Friends in Similar Tights). After defeating The Conundrum (Jigsaw and Rorschach) in the first round of the tournament, Icarus and Akuma were eliminated from the tournament by Icarus' former stable mates Hallowicked and Blind Rage of the Night Shift, who would go on to win the entire tournament. After the tournament Team F.I.S.T. began feuding with the Wildcards (Eddie Kingston and BlackJack Marciano). 2003 ended with the Wildcards taking advantage of a hairline fracture in Akuma's ankle and defeating Team F.I.S.T. in a No Disqualification match on October 18. In 2004 the feud evolved with Jigsaw joining the Wildcards to form the Toxic Trio, which led to Mike Quackenbush coming to the aid of Team F.I.S.T. The feud came to an end on May 22, 2004, at Chikara's third anniversary show, when Icarus, Akuma and Quackenbush defeated the Toxic Trio in an Ultimate Jeopardy match and as a result both of the Wildcards were shaved bald.\n\nThe Kings of Wrestling (2005\u20132007)\nAfter a disappointing 2005 Tag World Grand Prix, where Team F.I.S.T. was eliminated in the second round and two draws and a loss against the tag team of Mister ZERO and Shane Storm, known collectively as Men@Work, Icarus and Akuma turned rudo by attacking Storm and ZERO after a match on May 20, 2005. The following day Chris Hero invited Icarus and Akuma to join him, Claudio Castagnoli and Arik Cannon in the stable known as The Kings of Wrestling. On July 22 Icarus entered the third Young Lions Cup tournament. After defeating Prophet in his first round match and Rorschach, Mickie Knuckles, Sabian, Arik Cannon and Ricky Reyes in the 6-way semifinal match, Icarus advanced to the finals of the tournament, where he was defeated by Shane Storm. On September 16 Icarus received a rematch for the Young Lions Cup, but was once again defeated by Storm. 2005 ended with Icarus witnessing at ringside how Storm defeated his tag team partner Gran Akuma in a Mask vs. Mask match.\n\nthumb|left|(Left to right) Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Gran Akuma of Team F.I.S.T.\nIn 2006, Icarus targeted Jigsaw and started going after his mask on multiple occasions, which led to Chikara Commissioner Bob Saget booking the two in a Hair vs. Mask match. On July 22, Jigsaw defeated Icarus and afterwards Jolly Roger and Mister ZERO, both of whom were in kayfabe forced to retire the previous year thanks to assaults from Icarus, returned to shave him bald. Icarus bounced back on October 28 by winning the third annual torneo cibernetico match. On November 12 Icarus and Akuma defeated the teams of Silver Bullet #1 and Silver Bullet #2, Incoherence (Delirious and Hallowicked) and Cheech and Cloudy in a one night tournament to earn the right to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas, held by their stablemates Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli. F.I.S.T. cashed in their title match at the following event on November 17 and defeated Hero and Castagnoli two falls to one to become the second ever Chikara Tag Team Champions.

(Bobby Dempsey, Sara Del Rey and Tank Toland) and Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson), advancing to the quarterfinals of the tournament, before losing to The Colony (Fire Ant, Soldier Ant and Worker Ant). After defeating The Colony in a rematch during Chikara's sixth anniversary weekend, Icarus, Akuma and Taylor dubbed themselves \"Chikara's most dangerous trio\" and defeated trios like Sami Callihan, Steve Weiner and Ultimo Breakfast, Lince Dorado, Chiva II and Chiva III, Player Uno, Player Dos and Ultimo Breakfast and Lince Dorado, Angel de Fuego and Chiva II to prove their point.\n\nleft|thumb|Chuck Taylor and Icarus having their heads shaved after losing a Double Mask vs. Double Hair match against The Colony\nOn February 20, 2009, F.I.S.T. squared off once more with The Colony, this time in a 2009 King of Trios qualifying match.

(2010\u20132013)\nWith Gargano as a member, the new F.I.S.T. ended their losing streak by defeating Da Soul Touchaz (Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson) and 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews) and Soldier Ant in six-man tag team matches on September 18 and 19. On September 28 UltraMantis Black announced that he had recruited Icarus to join his team of Chikara originals, consisting of both rudos and tecnicos, who would face the rudo stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes in the seventh annual torneo cibernetico match on October 23. As a sign of unity between the Chikara originals, Icarus entered the match wearing his old Ichabod Slayne mask. He was eliminated from the match by BDK's Tim Donst. On April 15, 2011, F.I.S.T. entered the 2011 King of Trios, defeating Team Australia (Kabel, Percy T and Tama Williams) in their first round match. The following day F.I.S.T. defeated Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Ultimate Spider Jr.), avenging their loss from the previous year and advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. On April 17, F.I.S.T. scored a major upset in the semifinals of the King of Trios tournament by defeating Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki), when Icarus rolled up Sasuke for the win, after Taylor had blinded him with powder. Later that same day, F.I.S.T. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). In May, Icarus made his first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro Wrestling. In Chikara, Icarus started a rivalry with Gregory Iron, who defeated him in back-to-back matches on June 25 and September 18, leading Icarus to publicly accuse Iron of faking his cerebral palsy. On October 30, Icarus replaced stablemate Johnny Gargano, who was unable to attend an event due to traveling issues, and teamed with Chuck Taylor to successfully defend the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas against the Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield and Sugar Dunkerton). Icarus and Gregory Iron had what was billed as their final match against each other on November 13 at Chikara's first ever internet pay-per-view, High Noon, where Icarus was victorious following a low blow. Afterwards, Icarus was chased out of the ring by the returning Gran Akuma. On January 28, 2012, Icarus and Akuma had their first match against each other, which ended in a double countout. On February 25, Icarus again replaced an injured Gargano and teamed up with Taylor to successfully defend the Campeonatos de Parejas against the Spectral Envoy (Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black). On March 24, Icarus and Taylor lost the title to 3.0. On June 2 at Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, Icarus was defeated by Gran Akuma in a ladder match; as a result, Akuma earned a Chikara contract.\n\nOn August 2, Chikara's Director of Fun, Wink Vavasseur, named Sugar Dunkerton, who had announced his wish to join a stable, the fourth member of F.I.S.T. The other members, however, refused to accept Dunkerton as a full-fledged member, instead referring to him as their \"water boy\". On September 14, F.I.S.T., represented by Icarus, Gargano and Taylor, entered the 2012 King of Trios tournament, defeating Team Osaka Pro (Ebessan, Kikutaro and Takoyakida) in their first round match. The following day, F.I.S.T. defeated the all-female Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Kaori Yoneyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, F.I.S.T. was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by the Spectral Envoy (Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black), who went on to win the entire tournament.\n\nTecnico turn; Grand Champion (2013\u20132015)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in June 2015\nIn early 2013, Icarus began showing signs of a tecnico turn, when he started having problems with F.I.S.T. stablemates Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano. On May 3, Icarus turned on Gargano, hitting him with a spear, after Gargano had attacked Dunkerton, blaming him for a six-man tag team match loss against Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black. The turn led to Gargano quitting F.I.S.T. The following day, Dunkerton also severed his ties with Icarus and F.I.S.T., when Icarus interfered in his match with Gran Akuma, causing a disqualification. On June 2 at Aniversario: Never Compromise, Icarus received his first shot at the Chikara Grand Championship, however, the match ended in a no contest, when the arena was attacked by a group known as \"Condor Security\" just as Icarus had Kingston locked in a submission hold. When Chikara went inactive following the event, Icarus began holding fan gatherings and spearheaded a petition for the return of the promotion. The storyline culminated on February 1, 2014, during the second National Pro Wrestling Day, when the Chikara roster defeated the Flood, a united group of rudos from Chikara's past, in a mass brawl, leading to Icarus announcing the promotion's return. On May 25 at Chikara's return event, You Only Live Twice, Icarus defeated Kingston in a rematch to become the second Chikara Grand Champion. Icarus made his first successful title defense on August 17 against Juan Francisco de Coronado. In September, Icarus teamed up with the reigning Campeones de Parejas Dasher Hatfield and Mark Angelosetti as the Golden Trio for the 2014 King of Trios. They made it all the way to the finals of the tournament, before losing to the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). On October 26, Icarus defeated Flood representative Jimmy Jacobs for his second successful defense of the Grand Championship. Chikara's 2014 season culminated with Tomorrow Never Dies, where Icarus defeated Flood leader Deucalion in the promotion's second ever steel cage match. At the next season premiere on January 25, 2015, Icarus made his third successful defense of the Grand Championship against former F.I.S.T. stablemate Chuck Taylor. His fourth defense took place on March 8, when he defeated N\u00f8kken. On April 6, during Chikara's tour of the United Kingdom, Icarus lost the Chikara Grand Championship to Hallowicked. Icarus received a rematch for the Grand Championship at the season 15 finale on December 5 in a three-way match also involving Eddie Kingston, but was defeated by Hallowicked.\n\nThe HeXed Men (2016)\nleft|thumb|Icarus in February 2016\nOn May 7, 2016, Icarus entered a storyline, where his mind was taken over by UltraMantis Black, adding him to a new rudo group which also included Frightmare, Hallowicked, Kodama and Obariyon. As part of the new group, Icarus became a servant of an entity known as \"Nazmaldun\" and was dubbed \"The Morning Star\". On September 2, Icarus entered the 2016 King of Trios representing the new group, alongside stablemates Hallowicked and Jigsaw. They defeated Bullet Ant, Missile Assault Man and Worker Ant in their first round match. The following day, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw defeated Major League Moustache (Dasher Hatfield, Trent Seven and Tyler Bate) to advance to the semifinals of the tournament. On the third and final day of the tournament, Icarus, Hallowicked and Jigsaw were eliminated after being disqualified in their semifinal match against Team JWP (Command Bolshoi, Hanako Nakamori and Manami Katsu). On December 3, The HeXed Men lost to Chikara's Mightiest Heroes in a Torneo Cibernetico match. After the match, Ophidian took the Eye Of Tyr from UltraMantis Black, and only some of the HeXed Men were free from the spell.\n\nLater career (2017\u20132020)\nSince 2017, Icarus has been in some various storylines until Chikara close down in June 2020.\n\nDragon Gate USA and Evolve (2009\u20132010)\nOn July 25, 2009, Icarus appeared on Dragon Gate USA's first pay-per-view Enter the Dragon in an eight-man tag team Chikara showcase match, where he, Gran Akuma, Amasis and Hallowicked were defeated by Mike Quackenbush, Jigsaw, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant.\n\nOn January 16, 2010, Icarus made his debut for Evolve Wrestling, at the promotion's first ever show, teaming with Gran Akuma and Brodie Lee as Akuma's Army, in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Hallowicked, Frightmare and Mike Quackenbush.\n\nIndependent circuit (2020\u2013present)\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nthumb|Icarus as one-half of Chikara's Campeones de Parejas\nChikara\nChikara Campeonatos de Parejas (1 time) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nChikara Grand Championship (1 time)\nKing of Trios (2009) \u2013 with Chuck Taylor and Gran Akuma\nOne Night Tag Team Tournament (2006)\nTorneo Cibernetico (2006)\n #1 Contendership Tag Team Tournament (2006) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nExcellence Professional Wrestling\nExcellence Championship (1 time)\nCATender Tournament (2018)\nPro Wrestling Entertainment\nPWE Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPWE Tag Team Championship Tournament (2005) \u2013 with Gran Akuma\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nPWI ranked him #220 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2010\n\nLuchas de Apuestas record\n\nWinner (wager)Loser (wager)LocationEventDateNotesBlind Rage (hair)  Ichabod Slayne (mask)  Allentown, Pennsylvania  Season 1 Finale    Jigsaw (mask)  Icarus (hair)  Hellertown, Pennsylvania  The Crushing Weight of Mainstream Ignorance    Fire Ant and Soldier Ant (masks)  Icarus and Chuck Taylor (hairs)  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Aniversario Yang    \n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOnline World of Wrestling profile\n\nCategory:1982 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American male professional wrestlers\nCategory:Masked wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century male professional wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century American professional wrestlers\nCategory:Professional wrestlers from Pennsylvania",

        "text": "Pamala Stanley (born July 16, 1952) is an American disco and Hi-NRG singer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. She scored several dance/club hits from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. She is the sister of folk-pop recording artist and singer-songwriter James Lee Stanley.\n\nCareer\nStanley found success mainly in the club/dance markets thanks to five Billboard Club Play chart hits.\n\nShe first gained attention with her 1979 debut album, This Is Hot. The album was originally released in Germany on EMI Electrola (with a drastically different cover).  After scoring sizable chartings throughout Europe it was licensed to EMI America.  The album, with new cover photography, was remixed by producer Rick Gianatos and This Is Hot shot up to #16 on the Billboard Dance charts. She toured extensively throughout the US, Canada, Mexico and South America.\n\nIn 1983, she released her second hit \"I Don't Want To Talk About It\", written by her brother James Lee Stanley. The 12\" single was produced by Stanley and then husband Frank Mandaro for their own Komander label. It charted for fifteen weeks eventually climbing to No. 13 on the Billboard Dance charts. After her 1983 success Stanley landed a contract with TSR Records. This led to her 1984 Hi-NRG hit, \"Coming Out Of Hiding\", also co-written by her brother James Lee Stanley.  The 12\" single was again produced by Stanley and Mandaro and after fourteen weeks on the charts it peaked at #-4 on the Billboard Dance Charts. Through a licensing move TSR Records owner Tom Hayden sold the song to Mirage Records who re-released the 12\" single  as well as a 7\" version  for radio.\n\nNow on Mirage Records, Stanley's next release was the 1985 hit \"If Looks Could Kill\" (later covered by Heart), and used in the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Raw Deal. Once again she hit the Club Play charts peaking at #-23. Her next and last charting 12\" single was with Paul Parker. The double A-side duets of \"Stranger (In A Strange Land)\" and \"Running in Circles\".  The TSR Records release peaked at #-40 on the Club Play charts in early 1986.\n\nIn 1989 Stanley resurfaced on Beachwood Records. She released three 12\" singles for the small independent label. \"Rhiannon\" (a cover of the Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac hit),  \"Body Time\"  and a remake of \"Coming Out Of Hiding\". In 1990 the label released Coming Out Of Hiding...the sequel, a compilation of her greatest hits and new recordings. The remainder of the 1990s Stanley spent working with her band and exploring different genres of music outside the dance market.\n\nIn 1997 Live And Cookin (as The Pamala Stanley Band) was released on Shaker Records.  The album featured Stanley and the band covering New Orleans Blues and Jazz. It was recorded live in and around Ft. Lauderdale Florida in late 1986.\n\nIn 2002, she released It's All In The Game, a collection of Jazz classics from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, she released a Broadway-themed CD of showtunes entitled This Is The Moment featuring her most requested and favorite songs from Broadway shows.  She also did a compilation CD and DVD called Looking Back: The Disco Years 1979\u20131989, a 15 song greatest hits package. The companion DVD is out of print and a sought after collectible.\n\nIn 2007, Stanley released a new album of original material, Seasons of My Heart. The selections range from adult contemporary territory, with a little country and New Orleans jazz influence. One song from this album, (her recording of \"Survive\") would be chosen as the theme for several Susan G Komen \"Race for the Cure\" events.\n\nIn 2010 I Am There, a collection of inspirational and Christian songs, was released. Many of the songs were written by Stanley and her brother James. The album was recorded by Stanley and several members of her family in honor of her mother, Mary Stanley who died in 2004.\n\nStanley performed regularly at The Blue Moon in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware as well an several other well known venues around Rehoboth Beach.  She currently holds residency at Diego's Nightclub. In 2021, she launched a multi-camera live stream show available through her Facebook and YouTube channels, airing every Wednesday.\nStanley still tours regularly with many projects in the works, as stated on her official website, Myspace and Facebook pages. She tours extensively with many  cruise ships and Atlantis Events.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n This is Hot (1979)\n Coming Out of Hiding: The Sequel (1990)\n It's All In The Game (2002)\n This Is The Moment (2006)\n Looking Back: The Disco Years 1979\u20131989 (2006)\n Seasons of My Heart (2007)\n I Am There (2010) (compilation CD with sisters, brother and niece) (Stanley, Rogers & Young)\nStraight From The Heart \u2013 The Musical with James Lee Stanley and Chris Bennett (2015)\n\nSingles\n \"This Is Hot\" (#16 Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, 1979 / #108 Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100)\n \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" (#13 Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, 1983)\n \"Coming Out of Hiding\" (#4 Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, 1984 / #106 Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100)\n \"If Looks Could Kill\" (#23 Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, 1985)\n \"Stranger (In a Strange Land)\" / \"Running Around in Circles\" \u2013 Pamala Stanley and Paul Parker (#40 Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, 1986)\n \"Rhiannon\" (1988)\n \"Body Time\" (1989)\n \"Coming Out of Hiding\" (1990)\n \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\" (Almighty Mixes)\n \"Coming Out of Hiding\" (Almighty Mixes)\n \"If Looks Could Kill\" (Almighty Mixes)\n \"The Bank of Love\"\n  \"Lost in a Dream\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Myspace page\n Pride Entertainment Online Interview with Pamala Stanley\n Blue Moon Rehoboth\n\nCategory:1952 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American disco musicians\nCategory:American hi-NRG musicians\nCategory:American women pop singers\nCategory:American women singer-songwriters\nCategory:American women in electronic music\nCategory:EMI Records artists\nCategory:Mirage Records artists\nCategory:21st-century American women",

In the Riksdag, she has been part of the former Committee on Housing (2000\u20132002), the Committee on the Labour Market and the Committee on European Union Affairs (2002\u20132006). She also served as a regular member of the OSCE-delegation between 2002\u20132006 and is now a deputy member. After the election 2006, Annelie is her party's spokeswoman in traffic-related issues and a regular member of the Committee on the Transport and Communications. She also continues to serve in the OSCE-delegation.\n\nThe political focus of Annelie Enochson is concentrated to three issues; freedom of speech and religion in Sweden and internationally, compassion for the less fortunate, and the local issues of Gothenburg and its progress.\n\nWith a background in Gothenburg and the local development of the city, Enochson has several times by motions and interpellations pointed out the infrastructural jams that interfere with the growth of the city.\n\nThrough her international experiences, Enochson has in close proximity felt the consequences of the lack of freedoms in religion and speech. The parliamentary work of Enochson has repeatedly addressed these issues in countries like Turkey, Belarus, Iraq and the surrounding Middle East as a region.\n\nMinorities in China were given much media when Enochson nominated the Uighur champion of human rights Rebeiya Kad\u00e9er for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In April 2008, Enochson hosted a visit by Kad\u00e9er that rendered much attention in the Swedish media. Enochson is also a known friend of Israel and chairwoman of the chapter of the Sweden-Israel Friendship Association in West Sweden. In May 2008 Enochson was awarded the Jerusalem-price by the World Zionist Federation for her work in support of the nation of Israel.\n\nEnochson put forth a motion on \u201cAbducted Children\u201d in the Parliament in 2006.

        "text": "David Shelley Duncan (born September 29, 1979) is an American former professional baseball player. He was a left fielder, designated hitter, and first baseman. Duncan played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and Tampa Bay Rays. He was the Major League field coordinator for the Toronto Blue Jays, and later served as the analytics coordinator for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nPlaying career\nHigh school\nShelley graduated from Canyon del Oro High School, located in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, in 1998. While there he was a teammate of former All Star second baseman Ian Kinsler. He played on the school's 1997 baseball team that went on to capture the 5A State Championship title.\n\nCollege career\nIn 1999 he was a Freshman First Team All-American outfielder while attending the University of Arizona. In 2001, he was named First Team College All-American outfielder and Pacific-10 Conference All-Star. He was selected by the Yankees in the second round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, 62nd overall.\nleft|thumb|275x275px|Duncan during his tenure with the New York Yankees in 2008\n\nProfessional career\nNew York Yankees\nDuncan's slugging percentage was .410 with the Staten Island Yankees in 2001. He played outfield for the Greensboro Bats in 2002, where he had a .375 on-base percentage and 10 assists from the outfield in 69 games.\n\nPlaying with the Tampa Yankees of the Florida State League in 2004, Duncan hit 19 home runs in 424 at bats. With the Trenton Thunder in 2005, he hit a league-leading 34 home runs and had 92 RBIs. He was named an Eastern League (AA) mid-season and post-season All-Star first baseman. He was also the winner of the 2005 Eastern League All-Star Game Home Run Derby. In 2006, he hit 19 home runs for Trenton in 351 at-bats, and was twice the league's player of the week.\n\nIn 2007, Duncan was a member of the International League All-Star Team, and was the Topps IL Player of the Month in May while playing for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. While with the Yankees AAA team, Duncan had 25 home runs, second in the International League at the time he was called up, and hit .295 with a .577 slugging percentage in 336 at-bats.\n\nDuncan made his major league debut on July 20, 2007, as the designated hitter against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and recorded his first career hit and RBI. The next day, he hit his first major league home run against the Devil Rays, and the following day had his first multi-home run game, going deep twice in front of the Yankee Stadium crowd. Duncan later hit his fourth Major League home run at Yankee Stadium on July 31, 2007, against the Chicago White Sox. He spent time in 2008 with both the major league Yankees, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, before suffering a shoulder separation. Duncan remained in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the remainder of the season. He was designated for assignment that offseason, but cleared waivers and remained in the Yankees organization.\n\nOn July 31, 2009, Duncan was recalled from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre temporarily as an extra bat. He was optioned the following day and recalled again on September 7. In each of his three starts, he went 1-for-3 and recorded one RBI. Duncan was named the International League Most Valuable Player for 2009 leading the league in home runs and RBIs. Following the 2009 season, Duncan was outrighted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, but refused the assignment and elected to become a free agent.\n\nCleveland Indians\nthumb|287x287px|Duncan batting for the Cleveland Indians in 2012\nOn January 4, 2010, Duncan signed a contract with the Cleveland Indians. He began the season with the Triple-A Columbus Clippers.\n\nThe Indians designated Duncan for assignment on August 29, 2012. In 81 games with the club during the 2012 season, he hit .203 with 11 home runs and 31 RBIs.\n\nTampa Bay Rays\nOn January 22, 2013, Duncan signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. He was designated for assignment on April 30, 2013. He declared free agency on October 11.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nOn January 24, 2014, Duncan signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nCincinnati Reds\nDuncan signed a minor league deal with the Cincinnati Reds in May 2014. Duncan was released by the Reds on June 18, 2014.\n\nCoaching career\nArizona Diamondbacks\nOn January 7, 2015, Duncan was announced as the new manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks' Low-A affiliate, the Hillsboro Hops of the Northwest League. On February 6, 2017, Duncan was named the manager of the Diamondbacks' High-A affiliate, the Visalia Rawhide. Duncan was the manager of the Diamondbacks' Double-A affiliate, the Jackson Generals, for the 2018 season. They subsequently won the 2018 Southern League Championship.\n\nToronto Blue Jays\nOn November 26, 2018, Duncan was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays to be their Major League field coordinator. \n\nChicago White Sox\nOn December 1, 2020, Duncan was hired by the Chicago White Sox to be their analytics coordinator.\n\nNew York Yankees\nDuncan was hired to manage the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, the Triple-A affiliate for the New York Yankees, for the 2023 season.\n\nControversies\nDuncan was involved in some minor controversy on September 14, 2007, when, before the game between the Yankees and Red Sox at Fenway Park, Duncan wrote \"Red Sox Suck!\" along with his autograph on a 10-year-old Red Sox fan's notebook.\n\nDuring a spring training game on March 12, 2008, against the Tampa Bay Rays, after safely reaching first due to an error, Duncan continued on to second base, spiking second baseman Akinori Iwamura who had caught the ball well before Duncan arrived. Iwamura sustained a cut above his right knee but was otherwise fine, and Duncan was tagged out regardless. This followed the Rays\u2019 Elliot Johnson's aggressive hit on Yankee catcher Francisco Cervelli, which resulted in a broken wrist for the catcher. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, after which Duncan and Rays right fielder Jonny Gomes were ejected, as were two of the Yankees' coaches, Bobby Meacham and Kevin Long. On March 14, Duncan, teammate Melky Cabrera and Gomes were suspended for their actions on the field. Each of these three players' suspensions was reduced one day in length after they decided to drop their appeal of the suspensions.\n\n Personal life \nDuncan is the oldest son of Dave Duncan, an MLB catcher and pitching coach. His younger brother, Chris, was also an MLB first baseman and outfielder. As of 2018, Duncan is married to his wife Kirsten Duncan. They both live in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n See also \n\nList of second-generation Major League Baseball players\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMinor League Baseball profile \n\nCategory:1979 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American expatriate baseball people in Canada\nCategory:Baseball coaches from Arizona\nCategory:Baseball players from Tucson, Arizona\nCategory:Chicago White Sox coaches\nCategory:Cleveland Indians players\nCategory:Columbus Clippers players\nCategory:Durham Bulls players\nCategory:Greensboro Bats players\nCategory:Gulf Coast Yankees players\nCategory:Hillsboro Hops\nCategory:International League MVP award winners\nCategory:Louisville Bats players\nCategory:Major League Baseball first basemen\nCategory:Major League Baseball left fielders\nCategory:Minor league baseball managers\nCategory:New York Yankees players\nCategory:Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players\nCategory:Staten Island Yankees players\nCategory:Tampa Bay Rays players\nCategory:Tampa Yankees players\nCategory:Toronto Blue Jays coaches\nCategory:Trenton Thunder players\nCategory:Arizona Wildcats baseball players",

While with the Yankees AAA team, Duncan had 25 home runs, second in the International League at the time he was called up, and hit .295 with a .577 slugging percentage in 336 at-bats.\n\nDuncan made his major league debut on July 20, 2007, as the designated hitter against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and recorded his first career hit and RBI. The next day, he hit his first major league home run against the Devil Rays, and the following day had his first multi-home run game, going deep twice in front of the Yankee Stadium crowd. Duncan later hit his fourth Major League home run at Yankee Stadium on July 31, 2007, against the Chicago White Sox. He spent time in 2008 with both the major league Yankees, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, before suffering a shoulder separation. Duncan remained in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the remainder of the season. He was designated for assignment that offseason, but cleared waivers and remained in the Yankees organization.\n\nOn July 31, 2009, Duncan was recalled from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre temporarily as an extra bat. He was optioned the following day and recalled again on September 7. In each of his three starts, he went 1-for-3 and recorded one RBI. Duncan was named the International League Most Valuable Player for 2009 leading the league in home runs and RBIs. Following the 2009 season, Duncan was outrighted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, but refused the assignment and elected to become a free agent.\n\nCleveland Indians\nthumb|287x287px|Duncan batting for the Cleveland Indians in 2012\nOn January 4, 2010, Duncan signed a contract with the Cleveland Indians. He began the season with the Triple-A Columbus Clippers.\n\nThe Indians designated Duncan for assignment on August 29, 2012.

Duncan was released by the Reds on June 18, 2014.\n\nCoaching career\nArizona Diamondbacks\nOn January 7, 2015, Duncan was announced as the new manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks' Low-A affiliate, the Hillsboro Hops of the Northwest League. On February 6, 2017, Duncan was named the manager of the Diamondbacks' High-A affiliate, the Visalia Rawhide.

Iwamura sustained a cut above his right knee but was otherwise fine, and Duncan was tagged out regardless. This followed the Rays\u2019 Elliot Johnson's aggressive hit on Yankee catcher Francisco Cervelli, which resulted in a broken wrist for the catcher. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, after which Duncan and Rays right fielder Jonny Gomes were ejected, as were two of the Yankees' coaches, Bobby Meacham and Kevin Long. On March 14, Duncan, teammate Melky Cabrera and Gomes were suspended for their actions on the field. Each of these three players' suspensions was reduced one day in length after they decided to drop their appeal of the suspensions.\n\n Personal life \nDuncan is the oldest son of Dave Duncan, an MLB catcher and pitching coach. His younger brother, Chris, was also an MLB first baseman and outfielder. As of 2018, Duncan is married to his wife Kirsten Duncan. They both live in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n See also \n\nList of second-generation Major League Baseball players\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMinor League Baseball profile \n\nCategory:1979 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American expatriate baseball people in Canada\nCategory:Baseball coaches from Arizona\nCategory:Baseball players from Tucson, Arizona\nCategory:Chicago White Sox coaches\nCategory:Cleveland Indians players\nCategory:Columbus Clippers players\nCategory:Durham Bulls players\nCategory:Greensboro Bats players\nCategory:Gulf Coast Yankees players\nCategory:Hillsboro Hops\nCategory:International League MVP award winners\nCategory:Louisville Bats players\nCategory:Major League Baseball first basemen\nCategory:Major League Baseball left fielders\nCategory:Minor league baseball managers\nCategory:New York Yankees players\nCategory:Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players\nCategory:Staten Island Yankees players\nCategory:Tampa Bay Rays players\nCategory:Tampa Yankees players\nCategory:Toronto Blue Jays coaches\nCategory:Trenton Thunder players\nCategory:Arizona Wildcats baseball players",

He was exposed to Shakespeare's dialogues especially King Henry V, Hamlet, Midsummer Night Dream, Romeo and Juliet and others.\n\nAfter graduating from the Cambridge Senior School Certificate (CSC), Rais worked as a temporary teacher at Sekolah Kebangsaan Astana Raja, in Rembau. In 1963, Rais was accepted into the Language Teaching College (LI) as a trainee teacher for 2 years. While at LI, in addition to his duties as a trainee teacher, Rais produced many articles published by Utusan Zaman, Dewan Masharakat, Mastika and Dewan Bahasa. Rais enrolled at Stamford College and later went on to study Law at the University of Singapore.\n\nAt the University of Singapore, among the figures who became his lecturers were Ramachandran Naidu (former court interpreter in Kuala Lumpur), Sulaiman Abdullah (well-known lawyer) and Chandra Muzaffar (former vice president of PKR). Rais was very active in participating in debate and speech competitions at the University of Singapore and often met Chandra in the competition. He won the Beasley Shield Award for the general speech category, while Chandra won the debate competition.\n\nA lawyer by profession later, he received his Bachelor of Laws LL.B (Hons.)

His doctoral dissertation was eventually published in 1995 as Freedom Under Executive Power in Malaysia: A Study of Executive Supremacy.Yatim, Rais (1995). Freedom Under Executive Power in Malaysia: A Study of Executive Supremacy, p. xii. Endowment Publications. .\n\nPolitical career\nRais has held various positions in the national cabinet and other state government positions. He had been appointed a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Menteri Besar of Negeri Sembilan (1978\u20131982), Minister of Land and Regional Development (1982\u20131984), Minister of Information (1984\u20131986) and Foreign Minister (1986\u20131987).\n\nWhen he fell out of favour of the UMNO leadership in April 1987, he became the deputy leader of the opposition Parti Melayu Semangat 46 (S46 or Semangat 46), a breakaway party formed by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and UMNO members dissatisfied with Mahathir Mohamad's leadership. During that times he also he resumed his law career and worked with a firm, Ram, Rais & Partner, from 1987 to 1999. Like most Semangat 46 leaders, after the party was dissolved in 1996, he rejoined UMNO by the end of the decade. Upon his return to the ministry in 1999, as Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, he was effusive in his praise for Mahathir, who had outlasted the Semangat 46 movement with successive election victories. He held the ministry until the 2004 election, after which Abdullah Badawi, who had replaced Mahathir on his retirement, appointed him as Minister of Culture, Arts and Heritage.\n\nIn June 2007, Rais was nominated as a candidate for the post of the next Commonwealth Secretary-General after Don McKinnon's term in office ended in March 2008. However, he pulled out on 26 July, citing the lateness of campaigning, and his duties and commitments as the Main Committee of the upcoming 50th Merdeka celebrations, which limited him from travelling out of the country to lobby for his candidacy.\n\nRais served another term as Foreign Minister from 18 March 2008 until 9 April 2009, when the incoming Prime Minister Najib Razak appointed him as the Minister for Information, Communications and Culture. He remained in that ministry until the 2013 election, when he was dropped as a parliamentary candidate. Speaking generally about Barisan Nasional's decision to drop a number of senior figures from its parliamentary lineup, Najib stated that it was to \"satisfy the demands of voters who want to see Barisan Nasional and UMNO change and reform\". Rais accepted the decision and called on fellow UMNO members to remain loyal to the party. Within a few months he was appointed the President of the International Islamic University of Malaysia.\n\nOn 16 June 2020, he was appointed as a Senator in the Dewan Negara by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong after he joined BERSATU in June 2018 and returned to active politics.\n\nPersonal life\nHe is married to Masnah Rais. The couple has four children, namely Malini Rais, Dino Rais, Danni Rais and Ronni Rais. During his childhood and adolescence, Rais interacted a lot with the local Chinese community. This enabled him to speak Cantonese (the main Chinese language spoken throughout Negeri Sembilan) fluently, in addition to his native Negeri Sembilan Minangkabau, Standard Malay and English. His hobbies are photography and travelling and arts-culture. Apart from being highly skilled in photography, Rais is also talented in drawing. He obtained an A mark in the Higher School Certificate (HSC) examination.

He began making music as a hobby after graduating high school at Hayfield Secondary School, eventually recording tracks in a local studio in Falls Church, Virginia named Indie Media Lab. He released his first tracks on Bandcamp under the name Gold Link James. It was in 2013 that he began performing as GoldLink, releasing several free tracks on SoundCloud.\n\nGoldLink released his first mixtape The God Complex in July 2014. Complex named it one of the best projects released during the first half of 2014, Spin placed it at number 19 on its The 40 Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2014, Clash ranked it at number 7 on their Top 10 Mixtapes of 2014 and Pitchfork Media gave the mixtape a 7.9 rating.\n\nGoldLink began collaborating with producer Rick Rubin in 2015.

He released the single \"Fall In Love\" featuring rapper Cisero and produced by Canadian band BADBADNOTGOOD and Canadian producer and DJ Kaytranada. He later released the song \"Untitled\" with TDE rapper Isaiah Rashad. In December of that year, he saw his furthest commercial success following the release of his single \"Crew\" (featuring Shy Glizzy and Brent Faiyaz). It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 45, received six-times platinum certification by the RIAA, and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration; the single also spawned a remix by Georgia rapper Gucci Mane.\n\n2017\u2013present: At What Cost and Diaspora\nthumb|upright=0.7|GoldLink in 2016\nIn February 2017, Goldlink took part in \"Red Bull Sound Selects\" 3 Days Miami among artists Kelela, Angel Olsen, Brika, and others. On March 24, 2017, he released his debut album, At What Cost. It featured guest appearances from Wale, Shy Glizzy, Steve Lacy, Jazmine Sullivan, Kaytranada, M\u00fda, Ciscero, Kokayi, Hare Squead, Radiant Children, April George and Lil Dude. The project debuted at number 128 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Apart from \"Crew\", it also spawned the single \"Meditation\". \n\nOn June 7, 2018, GoldLink was featured on the song \"Like I Do\" by American singer Christina Aguilera from her eighth studio album, Liberation, which was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nOn June 12, 2019, GoldLink released his second studio album Diaspora. In an interview with Wonderland Magazine, he said that he considered \"At What Cost\" to be his breakout mixtape due to a label agreement and \"Diaspora\" as his debut album.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, GoldLink released his third studio album Haram!. In the run up to the album release, GoldLink began trolling some of his fellow rappers, tweeting insults and threats at Sheck Wes and sporting a fake facial jewel on his forehead in a July 13, 2021 The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon appearance, in apparent mockery of the facial jewelry trend popularized by Lil Uzi Vert and Sauce Walka. In the album's first single, \"White Walls,\" GoldLink continued his disses of Sheck Wes. The feud with Wes dates back to 2019 when GoldLink's then-girlfriend Justine Skye accused Wes of abuse, stalking, and harassment.\n\nControversy\n\n Mac Miller comments \nOn November 26, 2019, GoldLink wrote a post on Instagram that outlined both his appreciation for Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller, who died of an accidental overdose in 2018, and his belief the late star intentionally cribbed the sound of And After That, We Didn't Talk for Miller's album The Divine Feminine. GoldLink claimed he showed Miller his album while they were on tour together for Miller's previous album GO:OD AM and wrote the rapper loved it and had him play it for the whole touring crew. GoldLink pointed to similarities in the albums' structure and use of singer Anderson .Paak for a lead single. Paak responded in an Instagram post of his own, slamming GoldLink for having a \"God Complex\" and being disrespectful in the wake of their friend's death. On November 28, 2019, GoldLink spoke on the war of words at a concert in Hamburg, Germany, focusing on the love he expressed in the post for Miller and emphasizing he never accused the deceased rapper of stealing or copying.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions Certifications USUSR&B/HH AUS BEL(FL) NLD At What Cost Released: March 24, 2017\n Label: RCA Records\n Format: Digital download, LP, CD 12736\u2014\u2014\u2014 RIAA: Gold Diaspora Released: June 12, 2019\n Label: RCA, Squaaash Club\n Format: Digital download, LP, CD 77  40  70  148  87 Haram!

        "text": "D'Anthony William Carlos (born May 17, 1993), better known by his stage name GoldLink, is an American rapper and singer from Washington, D.C. He gained recognition following the release of his debut mixtape The God Complex (2014), which was met with critical acclaim. In 2015, he was chosen as part of the XXL Freshman Class and released his second mixtape, And After That, We Didn't Talk\u2014supported by the singles \"Dance on Me\" and \"Spectrum\". He signed with RCA Records to release his 2016 single \"Crew\" (featuring Brent Faiyaz and Shy Glizzy), which peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100, received sextuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It preceded the release of his debut studio album At What Cost (2017), which was met with continued positive reception despite trailing the single's commercial success. His second album, Diaspora (2019), entered the Billboard 200 at number 77.\n\nEarly life\nGoldLink's father was a parks and recreation worker and his mother a secretary at a law firm. After his parents separated, GoldLink moved to Bowie, Maryland with his mother and eventually settled in Virginia. He graduated from Hayfield Secondary School in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nCareer\n2013\u201316: Beginnings and breakthrough\nthumb|upright|left|GoldLink performing in May 2015\nGoldLink began his career performing under his birth name D'Anthony Carlos. He began making music as a hobby after graduating high school at Hayfield Secondary School, eventually recording tracks in a local studio in Falls Church, Virginia named Indie Media Lab. He released his first tracks on Bandcamp under the name Gold Link James. It was in 2013 that he began performing as GoldLink, releasing several free tracks on SoundCloud.\n\nGoldLink released his first mixtape The God Complex in July 2014. Complex named it one of the best projects released during the first half of 2014, Spin placed it at number 19 on its The 40 Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2014, Clash ranked it at number 7 on their Top 10 Mixtapes of 2014 and Pitchfork Media gave the mixtape a 7.9 rating.\n\nGoldLink began collaborating with producer Rick Rubin in 2015. In November 2015 he released the mixtape After That, We Didn't Talk, much of which was considered a follow-up to questions left unanswered from The God Complex. Pigeons & Planes placed it at number 19 on its Best Albums of 2015 list. GoldLink was also named a member of the XXL Freshman Class in 2015. In 2016, GoldLink signed a major deal with RCA Records and revealed he is working on his debut album for the label. He released the single \"Fall In Love\" featuring rapper Cisero and produced by Canadian band BADBADNOTGOOD and Canadian producer and DJ Kaytranada. He later released the song \"Untitled\" with TDE rapper Isaiah Rashad. In December of that year, he saw his furthest commercial success following the release of his single \"Crew\" (featuring Shy Glizzy and Brent Faiyaz). It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 45, received six-times platinum certification by the RIAA, and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration; the single also spawned a remix by Georgia rapper Gucci Mane.\n\n2017\u2013present: At What Cost and Diaspora\nthumb|upright=0.7|GoldLink in 2016\nIn February 2017, Goldlink took part in \"Red Bull Sound Selects\" 3 Days Miami among artists Kelela, Angel Olsen, Brika, and others.

        "text": "Roman Kreuziger (; born 6 May 1986) is a Czech former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 2006 and 2021 for six different teams. His father, Roman Kreuziger Sr., was also a bicycle racer who won the Tour of Austria in 1991 and the Cyclocross Junior World Championships in 1983.\n\nKreuziger competed as an all-rounder, with climbing and time trial abilities, becoming a contender for the General classification of stage races. He was also considered one of the biggest talents of the sport after winning the junior road race at the 2004 UCI Road World Championships and the 2008 Tour de Suisse at the age of 22. The next year, he won the 2009 Tour de Romandie and in 2013, he was the victor of the Amstel Gold Race.\n\nSince his retirement, Kreuziger now works as a directeur sportif for UCI WorldTeam .\n\nCareer\n\nLiquigas (2006\u20132010)\nHe turned professional in 2006 with Liquigas after a successful amateur career which saw him win the Junior Road World Championships in 2004 and a stage of the Giro delle Regioni in 2005. In 2007, he showed great improvements in his abilities by placing second in the prologues of Paris\u2013Nice and the Tour de Romandie, where he also finished sixth overall. He took his first professional victory in the second stage of the Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda. In late 2007, he also completed his first Grand Tour after finishing 21st in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 2008, he finished second in the Tour de Romandie, 35 seconds behind Andreas Kl\u00f6den, one of the world's leading riders. He avenged his loss by winning the Tour de Suisse by finishing 49 seconds ahead of Kl\u00f6den and winning the mountain time trial to Klausen Pass. In his first Tour de France, he proved himself as an excellent climber among the world's greats, eventually finishing second in the youth competition, and 12th overall. After the Tour, Kreuziger was known to be one of the future riders to potentially win grand tours.\n\nIn 2009, he got back to the Tour de Romandie and finally succeeded in his attempt to win the race, getting also one stage victory. He added to this success by finishing in ninth place in the Tour de France.\n\nIn 2010, he won the Giro di Sardegna, finished third in Paris\u2013Nice. Kreuziger's 9th overall in the Tour de France was a disappointment because it was not much of an improvement from his 9th-place finish in the 2009 Tour (though he would move into 8th after the Alberto Contador's stripped title). He then made the move from  to  after five seasons with the Italian team.\n\nAstana (2011\u20132012)\nthumb|left|upright|Kreuziger at the 2011 Tour de France\nIn 2011, Kreuziger won the mountains classification and a stage in the Giro del Trentino. He achieved a 4th-place finish in the Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge by winning the sprint of the chasing group, almost half-a-minute behind winner Philippe Gilbert. He then aimed for the Giro d'Italia. Kreuziger did not quite have the uphill strength that Contador, Nibali, and Scarponi had, causing him to miss out on the podium. He ended up finishing 5th overall and he also won the young rider's classification.\n\nIn 2012, he finished third in the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico. He entered the 2012 Giro d'Italia leading Team Astana with Paolo Tiralongo. He won the mountainous stage 19 after a solo breakaway but had a disappointing 15th overall finish.\n\nTeam Saxo\u2013Tinkoff (2013\u20132016)\nthumb|right|Kreuziger at the 2013 Tour de France\nKreuziger left  at the end of the 2012 season, and joined  on a three-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. In April 2013, he won the Amstel Gold Race. He broke free of the lead group with  to go and resisted the peloton's surge on the Cauberg, taking a solo triumph. Kreuziger worked with doping doctor Michele Ferrari according to former teammate Leonardo Bertagnolli. When asked about the allegations after the Amstel Gold Race, Kreuziger refused to comment on the ties, saying he would address the topic after the Tour de Romandie. He did and he admitted working with Ferrari from the autumn of 2006 through 2007 but that he did not use banned drugs. After the Amstel Gold Race, Kreuziger finished 3rd in the Tour de Suisse after aiming to win it.\n\nDespite riding the 2013 Tour to support Alberto Contador, Kreuziger left the Pyrenees 5th overall. After putting a solid time trial on stage 17, Kreuziger moved into the top three, moving ahead of Laurens ten Dam and Bauke Mollema. Despite moving into a high finish with Alberto Contador, Kreuziger slipped down to 5th overall after losing ground to Nairo Quintana and Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez in the alps.\n\nIn 2014, Kreuziger started his season finishing 8th in the Tour of Oman. He rode the Tirreno Adriatico in support of Alberto Contador though he finished 3rd overall with Contador winning the race. After, he rode through the Ardennes classics finishing in the top ten in the Fleche Wallonne and the Liege-Bastogne-Liege. He then finished 8th the Tour de Suisse.\n\nIn June 2014, Tinkoff-Saxo announced that Kreuziger was being temporarily suspended from racing after the UCI questioned abnormalities in his biological passport. The UCI had originally highlighted the problems in his biological data for the 2011 and 2012 seasons through a letter in June 2013, which Kreuziger had responded to in October 2013, even though the values did not get out of the biological passport range which determines what values the gained cyclist samples ought to have. The UCI subsequently followed this up in May 2014. This prevented Kreuziger from riding the Tour de France and Tour de Pologne. In August 2014, the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected an appeal by Kreuziger to allow him to start the 2014 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. On 22 September, it was announced that the Czech Olympic Committee had cleared him of any anti-doping violation and that he was free to compete again. The UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2014. The case was dropped by both agencies on 5 June 2015. Kreuziger took part in the 2015 Tour de France, finishing in 17th place.\n\n Orica\u2013Scott (2017\u20132018) \nIn August 2016,  announced the 'game-changing signing' of Kreuziger on a 2-year contract, ending at the end of the 2018 season. In his first season, Kreuziger took his only victory with the team at the Pro \u00d6tztaler 5500, a one-day race with  of climbing. In 2018, he recorded top-ten finishes in the three Ardennes classics races, with a best finish of second place at the Amstel Gold Race, losing a two-up sprint to Michael Valgren. He also finished in sixth place in the road race at the UCI Road World Championships, leading home the first chase group.\n\nTeam Dimension Data and Gazprom\u2013RusVelo (2019\u20132021)\nAfter two years with , Kreuziger joined  to bolster its roster for classic cycle races. In his two seasons with the team, he did not record a single top-ten individual finish.\n\nKreuziger joined  on a one-year contract, for the 2021 season. He failed to record any top-twenty individual finishes, and although he was offered a contract extension for 2022, Kreuziger elected to retire and became a directeur sportif with .\n\nMajor

        "text": "Roman Kreuziger (; born 6 May 1986) is a Czech former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 2006 and 2021 for six different teams. His father, Roman Kreuziger Sr., was also a bicycle racer who won the Tour of Austria in 1991 and the Cyclocross Junior World Championships in 1983.\n\nKreuziger competed as an all-rounder, with climbing and time trial abilities, becoming a contender for the General classification of stage races. He was also considered one of the biggest talents of the sport after winning the junior road race at the 2004 UCI Road World Championships and the 2008 Tour de Suisse at the age of 22. The next year, he won the 2009 Tour de Romandie and in 2013, he was the victor of the Amstel Gold Race.\n\nSince his retirement, Kreuziger now works as a directeur sportif for UCI WorldTeam .\n\nCareer\n\nLiquigas (2006\u20132010)\nHe turned professional in 2006 with Liquigas after a successful amateur career which saw him win the Junior Road World Championships in 2004 and a stage of the Giro delle Regioni in 2005. In 2007, he showed great improvements in his abilities by placing second in the prologues of Paris\u2013Nice and the Tour de Romandie, where he also finished sixth overall. He took his first professional victory in the second stage of the Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda. In late 2007, he also completed his first Grand Tour after finishing 21st in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 2008, he finished second in the Tour de Romandie, 35 seconds behind Andreas Kl\u00f6den, one of the world's leading riders. He avenged his loss by winning the Tour de Suisse by finishing 49 seconds ahead of Kl\u00f6den and winning the mountain time trial to Klausen Pass. In his first Tour de France, he proved himself as an excellent climber among the world's greats, eventually finishing second in the youth competition, and 12th overall. After the Tour, Kreuziger was known to be one of the future riders to potentially win grand tours.\n\nIn 2009, he got back to the Tour de Romandie and finally succeeded in his attempt to win the race, getting also one stage victory. He added to this success by finishing in ninth place in the Tour de France.\n\nIn 2010, he won the Giro di Sardegna, finished third in Paris\u2013Nice. Kreuziger's 9th overall in the Tour de France was a disappointment because it was not much of an improvement from his 9th-place finish in the 2009 Tour (though he would move into 8th after the Alberto Contador's stripped title). He then made the move from  to  after five seasons with the Italian team.\n\nAstana (2011\u20132012)\nthumb|left|upright|Kreuziger at the 2011 Tour de France\nIn 2011, Kreuziger won the mountains classification and a stage in the Giro del Trentino. He achieved a 4th-place finish in the Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge by winning the sprint of the chasing group, almost half-a-minute behind winner Philippe Gilbert. He then aimed for the Giro d'Italia. Kreuziger did not quite have the uphill strength that Contador, Nibali, and Scarponi had, causing him to miss out on the podium. He ended up finishing 5th overall and he also won the young rider's classification.\n\nIn 2012, he finished third in the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico. He entered the 2012 Giro d'Italia leading Team Astana with Paolo Tiralongo. He won the mountainous stage 19 after a solo breakaway but had a disappointing 15th overall finish.\n\nTeam Saxo\u2013Tinkoff (2013\u20132016)\nthumb|right|Kreuziger at the 2013 Tour de France\nKreuziger left  at the end of the 2012 season, and joined  on a three-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. In April 2013, he won the Amstel Gold Race. He broke free of the lead group with  to go and resisted the peloton's surge on the Cauberg, taking a solo triumph. Kreuziger worked with doping doctor Michele Ferrari according to former teammate Leonardo Bertagnolli. When asked about the allegations after the Amstel Gold Race, Kreuziger refused to comment on the ties, saying he would address the topic after the Tour de Romandie. He did and he admitted working with Ferrari from the autumn of 2006 through 2007 but that he did not use banned drugs. After the Amstel Gold Race, Kreuziger finished 3rd in the Tour de Suisse after aiming to win it.\n\nDespite riding the 2013 Tour to support Alberto Contador, Kreuziger left the Pyrenees 5th overall. After putting a solid time trial on stage 17, Kreuziger moved into the top three, moving ahead of Laurens ten Dam and Bauke Mollema. Despite moving into a high finish with Alberto Contador, Kreuziger slipped down to 5th overall after losing ground to Nairo Quintana and Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez in the alps.\n\nIn 2014, Kreuziger started his season finishing 8th in the Tour of Oman. He rode the Tirreno Adriatico in support of Alberto Contador though he finished 3rd overall with Contador winning the race. After, he rode through the Ardennes classics finishing in the top ten in the Fleche Wallonne and the Liege-Bastogne-Liege. He then finished 8th the Tour de Suisse.\n\nIn June 2014, Tinkoff-Saxo announced that Kreuziger was being temporarily suspended from racing after the UCI questioned abnormalities in his biological passport. The UCI had originally highlighted the problems in his biological data for the 2011 and 2012 seasons through a letter in June 2013, which Kreuziger had responded to in October 2013, even though the values did not get out of the biological passport range which determines what values the gained cyclist samples ought to have. The UCI subsequently followed this up in May 2014. This prevented Kreuziger from riding the Tour de France and Tour de Pologne. In August 2014, the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected an appeal by Kreuziger to allow him to start the 2014 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. On 22 September, it was announced that the Czech Olympic Committee had cleared him of any anti-doping violation and that he was free to compete again. The UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2014. The case was dropped by both agencies on 5 June 2015. Kreuziger took part in the 2015 Tour de France, finishing in 17th place.\n\n Orica\u2013Scott (2017\u20132018) \nIn August 2016,  announced the 'game-changing signing' of Kreuziger on a 2-year contract, ending at the end of the 2018 season. In his first season, Kreuziger took his only victory with the team at the Pro \u00d6tztaler 5500, a one-day race with  of climbing. In 2018, he recorded top-ten finishes in the three Ardennes classics races, with a best finish of second place at the Amstel Gold Race, losing a two-up sprint to Michael Valgren. He also finished in sixth place in the road race at the UCI Road World Championships, leading home the first chase group.\n\nTeam Dimension Data and Gazprom\u2013RusVelo (2019\u20132021)\nAfter two years with , Kreuziger joined  to bolster its roster for classic cycle races. In his two seasons with the team, he did not record a single top-ten individual finish.\n\nKreuziger joined  on a one-year contract, for the 2021 season. He failed to record any top-twenty individual finishes, and although he was offered a contract extension for 2022, Kreuziger elected to retire and became a directeur sportif with .\n\nMajor

The next year, he won the 2009 Tour de Romandie and in 2013, he was the victor of the Amstel Gold Race.\n\nSince his retirement, Kreuziger now works as a directeur sportif for UCI WorldTeam .\n\nCareer\n\nLiquigas (2006\u20132010)\nHe turned professional in 2006 with Liquigas after a successful amateur career which saw him win the Junior Road World Championships in 2004 and a stage of the Giro delle Regioni in 2005. In 2007, he showed great improvements in his abilities by placing second in the prologues of Paris\u2013Nice and the Tour de Romandie, where he also finished sixth overall. He took his first professional victory in the second stage of the Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda. In late 2007, he also completed his first Grand Tour after finishing 21st in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 2008, he finished second in the Tour de Romandie, 35 seconds behind Andreas Kl\u00f6den, one of the world's leading riders. He avenged his loss by winning the Tour de Suisse by finishing 49 seconds ahead of Kl\u00f6den and winning the mountain time trial to Klausen Pass. In his first Tour de France, he proved himself as an excellent climber among the world's greats, eventually finishing second in the youth competition, and 12th overall. After the Tour, Kreuziger was known to be one of the future riders to potentially win grand tours.\n\nIn 2009, he got back to the Tour de Romandie and finally succeeded in his attempt to win the race, getting also one stage victory. He added to this success by finishing in ninth place in the Tour de France.\n\nIn 2010, he won the Giro di Sardegna, finished third in Paris\u2013Nice. Kreuziger's 9th overall in the Tour de France was a disappointment because it was not much of an improvement from his 9th-place finish in the 2009 Tour (though he would move into 8th after the Alberto Contador's stripped title). He then made the move from  to  after five seasons with the Italian team.\n\nAstana (2011\u20132012)\nthumb|left|upright|Kreuziger at the 2011 Tour de France\nIn 2011, Kreuziger won the mountains classification and a stage in the Giro del Trentino. He achieved a 4th-place finish in the Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge by winning the sprint of the chasing group, almost half-a-minute behind winner Philippe Gilbert. He then aimed for the Giro d'Italia. Kreuziger did not quite have the uphill strength that Contador, Nibali, and Scarponi had, causing him to miss out on the podium. He ended up finishing 5th overall and he also won the young rider's classification.\n\nIn 2012, he finished third in the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico. He entered the 2012 Giro d'Italia leading Team Astana with Paolo Tiralongo. He won the mountainous stage 19 after a solo breakaway but had a disappointing 15th overall finish.\n\nTeam Saxo\u2013Tinkoff (2013\u20132016)\nthumb|right|Kreuziger at the 2013 Tour de France\nKreuziger left  at the end of the 2012 season, and joined  on a three-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. In April 2013, he won the Amstel Gold Race. He broke free of the lead group with  to go and resisted the peloton's surge on the Cauberg, taking a solo triumph. Kreuziger worked with doping doctor Michele Ferrari according to former teammate Leonardo Bertagnolli. When asked about the allegations after the Amstel Gold Race, Kreuziger refused to comment on the ties, saying he would address the topic after the Tour de Romandie. He did and he admitted working with Ferrari from the autumn of 2006 through 2007 but that he did not use banned drugs. After the Amstel Gold Race, Kreuziger finished 3rd in the Tour de Suisse after aiming to win it.\n\nDespite riding the 2013 Tour to support Alberto Contador, Kreuziger left the Pyrenees 5th overall. After putting a solid time trial on stage 17, Kreuziger moved into the top three, moving ahead of Laurens ten Dam and Bauke Mollema. Despite moving into a high finish with Alberto Contador, Kreuziger slipped down to 5th overall after losing ground to Nairo Quintana and Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez in the alps.\n\nIn 2014, Kreuziger started his season finishing 8th in the Tour of Oman. He rode the Tirreno Adriatico in support of Alberto Contador though he finished 3rd overall with Contador winning the race. After, he rode through the Ardennes classics finishing in the top ten in the Fleche Wallonne and the Liege-Bastogne-Liege. He then finished 8th the Tour de Suisse.\n\nIn June 2014, Tinkoff-Saxo announced that Kreuziger was being temporarily suspended from racing after the UCI questioned abnormalities in his biological passport. The UCI had originally highlighted the problems in his biological data for the 2011 and 2012 seasons through a letter in June 2013, which Kreuziger had responded to in October 2013, even though the values did not get out of the biological passport range which determines what values the gained cyclist samples ought to have. The UCI subsequently followed this up in May 2014. This prevented Kreuziger from riding the Tour de France and Tour de Pologne. In August 2014, the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected an appeal by Kreuziger to allow him to start the 2014 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. On 22 September, it was announced that the Czech Olympic Committee had cleared him of any anti-doping violation and that he was free to compete again. The UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2014. The case was dropped by both agencies on 5 June 2015. Kreuziger took part in the 2015 Tour de France, finishing in 17th place.\n\n Orica\u2013Scott (2017\u20132018) \nIn August 2016,  announced the 'game-changing signing' of Kreuziger on a 2-year contract, ending at the end of the 2018 season. In his first season, Kreuziger took his only victory with the team at the Pro \u00d6tztaler 5500, a one-day race with  of climbing. In 2018, he recorded top-ten finishes in the three Ardennes classics races, with a best finish of second place at the Amstel Gold Race, losing a two-up sprint to Michael Valgren. He also finished in sixth place in the road race at the UCI Road World Championships, leading home the first chase group.\n\nTeam Dimension Data and Gazprom\u2013RusVelo (2019\u20132021)\nAfter two years with , Kreuziger joined  to bolster its roster for classic cycle races. In his two seasons with the team, he did not record a single top-ten individual finish.\n\nKreuziger joined  on a one-year contract, for the 2021 season. He failed to record any top-twenty individual finishes, and although he was offered a contract extension for 2022, Kreuziger elected to retire and became a directeur sportif with .\n\nMajor

        "text": "David Uosikkinen (born February 11, 1956) is an American drummer and Internet content manager, best known for being a \nmember of rock band The Hooters.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, U.S., Uosikkinen grew up in Levittown, Pennsylvania and at eight years old, took up the trumpet. His father regularly took him to see jazz bands at the Lambertville Music Circus and after he saw The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964, Uosikkinen realized that music and being in a band was what he wanted to pursue with his life. He eventually turned to the drums when a neighbor let him play on his new set.\n\nHe graduated from Woodrow Wilson (now Harry S. Truman) High School in 1974, where he participated in gymnastics. After high school, Uosikkinen played in a number of Philadelphia area bands, including The Kooks, The Torpedoes, Hot Property and Youth Camp.\n\nUosikkinen's parents are both immigrants from Finland.\n\nTenure with The Hooters\nIn 1980, Uosikkinen joined Philadelphia musicians Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian when they decided to try something new by combining reggae, ska, and rock and roll to create The Hooters.\n\nNervous Night, The Hooters' 1985 debut on Columbia Records, sold in excess of 2 million copies and included Billboard Top 40 hits \"Day By Day\" (#18), \"And We Danced\" (#21) and \"Where Do The Children Go\" (#38).\n\nAfter releasing six albums, The Hooters obtained a large global following throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As a result, they were asked to open three major musical events of the late 20th century: Live Aid in Philadelphia in 1985, Amnesty International Concert at Giants Stadium in 1986, and Roger Waters' The Wall Concert in Berlin in 1990. In 1995, The Hooters went on hiatus.\n\nUosikkinen reunited with The Hooters on successful headlining European summer tours in 2003 to 2005.\n\n2007 saw the release of Time Stand Still, their first album of new material since 1993.\n\nOther musical projects\nIn 1994, Uosikkinen and entrepreneur, Dave Macrae, launched an independent record label, Moskeeto Records.\n\nIn 2010, Uosikkinen began his project, In The Pocket: Essential Songs of Philadelphia creating a fund raising campaign for the Settlement Music School. In The Pocket is recording the \"essential songs\" Of Philadelphia.\n\nDocumentary music videos are being recorded and songs can be downloaded at the project's website and on iTunes. Others working on the project include Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman of The Hooters, Jeffrey Gaines, Richard Bush and Rick DiFonzo of The A's, Greg Davis of Beru Revue, and William Wittman of Too Much Joy.\n\nCareer in technology\nIn 1999, Uosikkinen was asked to join a group of technology experts and music aficionados who created an online music portal, MP3.com, which subsequently changed the music industry's distribution and consumer listening habits.\n\nIn 2005, Uosikkinen took a position at another technology company, MP3tunes, a Music Service Provider (MSP) and originator of Oboe, a system that allowed unlimited online storage for users. In 2006, he went on to manage content for VMix, a site that featured music videos and other compositions by film makers in various genres.\n\nCurrently, when not touring or recording with The Hooters, Uosikkinen works at 6StringMedia, a web development and marketing company.\n\nIn January 2009, Uosikkinen launched Dave U Drums, an internet service where musicians send him an outline of a song, pay a recording fee, and Uosikkinen will deliver a finished drum track within 72 hours.\n\nPersonal life\nUosikkinen moved to California in 1991, initially to Los Angeles before moving to San Diego. He moved back to Philadelphia in 2009 where he resides with his wife, Dallyn Pavey. He has one son, Sam, who was born in 1990.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n David Uosikkinen official website\n Dave U Drums\n Songs In The Pocket\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1956 births\nCategory:American male drummers\nCategory:American rock drummers\nCategory:The Hooters members\nCategory:American people of Finnish descent\nCategory:Musicians from Philadelphia\nCategory:People from Levittown, Pennsylvania\nCategory:People from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania\nCategory:20th-century American drummers\nCategory:20th-century American male musicians",

        "text": "Hologram, also known by his former ring name Aram\u00eds, is a Mexican luchador enmascarado (masked professional wrestler). He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW). He is known for his time with Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), and International Wrestling Revolution Group. Aram\u00eds participated in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's Battle of Los Angeles 2019 event, which was his United States debut.\n\nHis real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico, where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.\n\nCareer\n\n Early career (2010\u20132018) \nIn 2010, Aram\u00eds wrestled his first matches on the Mexican independent scene.\n\nIn 2015, Aram\u00eds founded the group Los Kamikazes del Aire with Iron Kid and Alas de Acero. The group also featured Bandido while Iron Kid toured in Macau for a year. The group had success in IWRG and the independent wrestling scene in Mexico.\n\n Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2018\u20132024) \nIn 2018, he began wrestling in Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) under a free contract where he is allowed to work independently, and has therefore appeared in many other federations and events in the independent scene of Mexico and the United States. He also has fought in Lucha Memes, MexaWrestling and others. In the United States he has fought in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla and participated in their Battle of Los Angeles tournament in 2019.\n\nAll Elite Wrestling (2024\u2013present)\nIn February 2024, Aram\u00eds signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW). In July 2024, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) aired vignettes of a new wrestler called Hologram, which is a gimmick created by AEW owner and head of creative Tony Khan. It was later reported that Aram\u00eds would be portraying the character. On the July 20 episode of AEW Collision, Hologram would make his in-ring debut, defeating Gringo Loco. In October 2024, Hologram began a feud with La Facc\u00edon Ingobernable or LFI (Rush, Dral\u00edstico, and The Beast Mortos). This led to a 2 out of 3 falls match between Hologram and Mortos at WrestleDream, which Hologram won 2-1. On the October 19 episode of Collision, Hologram was attacked backstage by LFI. This was done to write him off television after suffering an ankle injury.\n\nOn the February 8, 2025 episode of Collision, Hologram returned from injury, aiding Komander from an attack by LFI.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nGladiadores Azteca de Lucha Libre Internacional\nGALLI Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Arez\nGALLI Indiscutible Championship (1 time, current)\nInternational Wrestling Revolution Group\nIWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Imposible\nIWRG Rey del Aire Championship (1 time)\nLucha Memes / MexaWrestling\nBattle of Naucalpan (2019)\nProfesionales de Lucha Libre Mexicana\nNuevos Valore tournament (2012)\nPromociones Cara Lucha\nBestiario I tournament (2015)\nWarrior Wrestling\nWarrior Wrestling Lucha Championship (1 time)\n\n Pro Wrestling Illustrated\n Ranked No. 247 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2024\n\nLuchas de Apuestas record\n\nWinner (wager)Loser (wager)LocationEventDateNotesAram\u00eds (mask)  Agora (hair)  Coacalco, State of Mexico  PROLLM Show    Aram\u00eds (mask)  Dragon Negro (mask)  Coacalco, State of Mexico  PROLLM Show    Aram\u00eds (mask)  Madison Kid (hair)  Naucalpan, State of Mexico  IWRG Show   Aram\u00eds (mask)  Eterno (hair)  Coacalco, State of Mexico  Lucha Memes show    \n\nFootnotes\n\n References \n\n External links \n \n\nCategory:21st-century male professional wrestlers\nCategory:21st-century Mexican professional wrestlers\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:Masked wrestlers\nCategory:Mexican male professional wrestlers\nCategory:Professional wrestlers from Mexico City\nCategory:Professional wrestlers from the State of Mexico\nCategory:Unidentified wrestlers\nCategory:People from Coacalco de Berrioz\u00e1bal",

        "text": "S. P. Varma is a social worker and peace activist from Jammu and Kashmir. He has been actively involved in peace-building efforts in conflict-ridden areas of the Kashmir valley.\n\n Early life and career \nIn 1990, he met Nirmala Deshpande, a prominent Gandhian figure, in Jammu, which influenced his decision to leave his government job as a Civil Engineer and embrace Gandhism.\n\nVarma organized local communities to facilitate inter-faith meetings with the aim of rebuilding trust in the troubled Kashmir valley. He expanded this movement to other disturbed regions such as Doda, Udhampur, Rajouri, and Poonch. This success motivated him to gradually extend his efforts to other parts of India, particularly in North East India and areas affected by Naxalite insurgency.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2015, S. P. Varma coordinated National Integration Camps, Aman Melas, Peace Marches, All-faith prayers, Seminars, Conferences, Workshops, Gandhian quiz competitions, and cultural-sports events in collaboration with various agencies.\n\nHe also collaborated with Sunil Dutt, a Union Minister and noted Bollywood actor, to lead the work of Sadbhawana ke Sipahi in Jammu and Kashmir as the chairman of the local chapter.\n\nIn 2012, the Government of India recognized his contributions with the Padma Shri award. In 2017, De Montfort University, England, conferred an Honorary Doctorate (D Lit) on him for his peace work in India.\n\nSince 2016, he has served as the NGO delegate for the Gandhi Global Family to the UN Department of Global Communication (DGC), New York.\n\n Voluntary Services and Awareness Programs \n\nOne of Varma's notable achievements is the organization of symposiums on truth and non-violence. These symposiums took place in schools, colleges, and universities across Jammu and Kashmir States from 1990 to 2015. What began as a local endeavor evolved into a national movement in 2010, thanks to support from the Union Ministry of HRD.\n\nIn April 1997, Varma organized the All India Gandhian Workers National Samelan, a significant event held at M.A. Stadium, Jammu. This gathering attracted over 25,000 Gandhian Workers from across the country. The summit featured a notable address by the then Prime Minister, Shri I.K. Gujral.\n\nVarma provided these invaluable texts to over 100,000 individuals in Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, Varma supplied complete sets of Mahatma Gandhi's autobiographies in different languages to numerous high-ranking dignitaries and grassroots workers.\n\nOn 20 January 2003, Varma orchestrated the Jammu and Kashmir State Sadbhavana \u2013 Ke \u2013 Sipahi convention. This event drew thousands of SKS volunteers from across the state. Distinguished figures like Hon\u2019ble Congress President Smt. Sonia Gandhi, Jammu and Kashmir PCC President Jenab Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji graced the occasion. Smt. Sonia Gandhi used this platform to present the \"Rajiv Gandhi State Sadbhavana Awards\" to commend outstanding individuals and organizations for their work in promoting peace and harmony, regardless of political affiliations.\n\nUnder Varma's leadership, the \"Bharat Jodo Abhiyan\" was launched in Srinagar. This initiative saw thousands of Sadbhavana Ke Sipahi from the State come together to commemorate the sacrifices of Mahatma Gandhi, Smt. Indira Gandhi, and Sh. Rajiv Gandhi. Participants pledged to work tirelessly for the unity and integrity of the nation. Their dedication earned them recognition from Jenab Ghulam Nabi Azad, President PCC Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nVarma had organised a variety of social awareness programs. These initiatives tackle critical issues such as Anti-Dowry systems, Save the Girl Child, Drug Abuse, Gender Equality, and Ecology Literacy.\n\nS. P. Varma played a significant role in identifying and engaging with Veteran Gandhians and Freedom Fighters, publicly acknowledging their contributions, and harnessing their experiences to instill a sense of national pride among the younger generation.\n\nFor over 30 years, S. P. Varma has been actively involved in organizing annual events to commemorate key dates in Indian history, including:\n Celebrating Gandhi Jayanti on 2 October at Srinagar (at SKICC, Rajbagh, and Sonawar).\n Observing Martyrs Day on 30 January at Dewan \u2013 e \u2013 Aam, Mubarak Mandi Palace, Jammu.\n Celebrating Children's Day on 14 November, coinciding with the birthday of Jawaharlal Nehru, in Jammu and Srinagar. On this occasion, Nehru Youth Medals are awarded to talented youths, one per district, in recognition of their contributions to peace and harmony.\n\nS. P. Varma has been actively involved in commemorating the birth and death anniversaries of 80 prominent freedom fighters from across the nation at various locations throughout the country.\n\nFurthermore, S. P. Varma has played a role in fostering communal harmony by organizing joint celebrations of various national festivals, including Independence Day, Republic Day, Gandhi Jayanti, Diwali, EID, Gurupurab, Christmas, Buddha Jayanti, and Mahavir Janma Kalyanak. These celebrations involve active participation from people of all faiths, promoting unity and inclusivity.\n\nIn 2002, S. P. Varma organized the Sadbhavana Padyatra, led by Sh. Sunil Dutt, from the Golden Temple in Amritsar to the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, passing through the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2010, S. P. Varma actively participated in Padyatras alongside notable figures such as Didi Nirmala Deshpande, Sh. Sunil Dutt, and Sh. Sunder Lal Bahuguna. These Padyatras aimed to promote peace, harmony, and the protection of the environment, taking place in various parts of the country.\n\nS. P. Varma also organized exposure trips for Gandhian Workers from Jammu and Kashmir to other regions of India starting in 1992, allowing them to participate in Annual Conventions.\n\nOn 17 October 2010, the Gandhians Parikrama for Peace commenced from Kanyakumari. This Parikrama sought to promote peace, harmony, integration, and raise awareness against prevailing social issues.\n\nAs the Vice President of the Gandhi Global Family, S. P. Varma coordinated the Gandhian\u2019s Parikrama around the country, beginning from Kanyakumari and ending in Kashmir. Led by young Gandhian Shri P. Maruthi of Chennai, the journey followed the South-Eastern Ghat and Central, Western Ghat routes.

        "text": "Brett Barry Clark (born December 23, 1976) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey defenceman. He previously played in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens, Atlanta Thrashers, Colorado Avalanche, Tampa Bay Lightning and the Minnesota Wild.\n\nPlaying career\nClark was drafted in the 6th round, 154th overall, by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected from the University of Maine of the Hockey East where he named to the All-Rookie Team in his freshman year. Under the preference of the Canadiens, Clark spent the following season developing with the Canadian National Team program, before he made his professional debut in the 1997\u201398 season.\n\nAfter only 20 games with AHL affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens, Clark made his debut with the Canadiens and remained with the team scoring a goal, on his 21st birthday, in 41 games for the season. Not used as a depth defenseman in the playoffs, he further established himself in the 1998\u201399 season, appearing in 61 contests for the Canadiens.\n\nOn June 25, 1999, Clark was claimed in the 1999 expansion draft by the Atlanta Thrashers. His NHL career stalled with the Thrashers, unable to find a role in his three seasons. He found success on the Thrashers' minor-league affiliate team, winning  the Turner Cup in 2001 with the Orlando Solar Bears.\n\nDuring the 2001\u201302 season on January 24, 2002, Clark was traded by the Thrashers to the Colorado Avalanche for Frederic Cassivi. He spent the majority of the next three seasons with the Avalanche's affiliate, the Hershey Bears of the AHL. He was twice named the Bears' best defenseman of the year, and led the AHL in plus/minus (+28) in 2000\u201301.\n\nAfter the 2004 NHL Lockout, and at age 28, Clark finally established a role as a two-way defenseman with the Avalanche in 2005\u201306. He appeared in 80 games and scored a respectable 36 points. In his playoff debut, he scored against the Dallas Stars in game one of the Western Conference Quarterfinals on April 22, and subsequently finished the playoffs tied with Rob Blake for the team scoring lead among defenseman with four points. On June 30, 2006, Clark re-signed on a two-year contract with Colorado.\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Clark had a career-high year appearing in 82 games and scoring 10 goals for 39 points and leading the NHL in average shifts per game. On February 24, 2007, Clark played in his 300th career NHL game against the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nOn August 27, 2007, Clark signed a two-year contract extension with the Avalanche prior to the 2007\u201308 season. He again led the NHL in shifts per game before he was sidelined for the rest of the regular season and playoffs after suffering a dislocated shoulder on February 12, 2008. In 2008\u201309 Clark returned to set an Avalanche record of 238 hits, second in the NHL, but struggled offensively in recording 12 points in 76 games. In the 2009\u201310 season, on January 29, Clark appeared in his 500th career NHL game against the Dallas Stars.\n\nAfter eight seasons within the Avalanche organization Clark left as a free agent to sign a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on July 5, 2010. In the 2010\u201311 season, Clark was re-inserted on the powerplay with the Lightning and produced 9 goals for his highest total since 2007, helping the Lightning advance to the 2011 Eastern Conference finals.\n\nA free agent upon the 2012 NHL lockout, Clark signed an AHL contract with the Oklahoma City Barons during the midpoint of the 2012\u201313 season on January 21, 2013. Clark immediately established himself within the Barons producing 17 points in just 18 games. On March 13, 2013, Clark signalled his return to the NHL after he was signed to add a veteran presence for the remainder of the season with the Minnesota Wild. Clark primarily was used as a reserve defensemen however played in 8 games with the Wild, compiling 1 assist.\n\nA free agent again well into the 2013\u201314 season, Clark signed a professional try-out with the Lake Erie Monsters on December 6, 2013, marking a return of sorts to NHL affiliate, the Colorado Avalanche. Unable to help the Monsters qualify for the playoffs, Clark was still able to contribute from the blueline with 6 goals and 14 points in 53 games.\n\nCoaching career\nPrior to the 2014\u201315 season, Clark announced the end of his playing career but remained in the Avalanche organization by accepting a player development consultant position.

She has recorded as a session musician with an array of critically acclaimed artists in addition to recording her own albums. Jordan pioneered a bebop and scat jazz singing style with an upright bass as the only accompaniment. Jordan's music has earned praise from many critics, particularly for her ability to improvise lyrics; Scott Yanow describes her as \"one of the most consistently creative of all jazz singers.\" Charlie Parker often introduced Jordan as \"the lady with the million dollar ears.\"\"Saturday, March 21st: 10:30 \u2013 Focus on Women in Music\".

Retrieved May 10, 2022.\n\nBiography\nEarly career\nSheila Jordan was born in Detroit, Michigan. Her childhood was very difficult. Her mother was only 17 when Sheila was born and struggled to raise a child, unfortunately turning to alcohol as a means of coping. Jordan was sent to live with her grandparents in the small coal mining town of Summerhill, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny Mountains. She grew up with nine siblings who were really her aunts and uncles. Life with her grandparents was difficult -- money was tight, there was little warmth or affection from her grandparents, and her grandfather was also an alcoholic. Jordan has said: \"We were probably the poorest people in a poor town\u2026we had an outhouse and no water in the house\u2026 In the wintertime all of us would sleep in one bedroom without any sheets or pillowcases on the beds; we just had blankets.\u201d\n\nShe returned to Detroit, living with her mother, in 1940 or 1942. She sang and played piano in jazz clubs in Detroit. She was a member of the trio Skeeter, Mitch, and Jean (Skeeter Spight, Leroi Mitchell, and Jordan, using part of her middle name, was \"Jean\"), which wrote lyrics to music by Charlie Parker. They went to Parker's performances in Detroit, met him, and he would ask them to sing.\n\nIn 1951, Jordan moved to New York City and studied harmony and music theory with Lennie Tristano and Charles Mingus, but concentrated onthe music of Charlie Parker. Jordan and Parker became friends before his death in 1955; she refers to him as one of her teachers. From 1952\u20131962, she was married to Duke Jordan, who played piano in Parker's band.  Although the marriage was unhappy (Duke Jordan was addicted to heroin),it produced a daughter, Tracy, of whom Sheila says she finally had someone \u201cthat I could truly love and that I was sure would love me back\u201d.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with JazzWax, when asked why she moved to New York, Jordan said, \"I guess I was chasin' the Bird [Parker].\" When asked if the song \"Chasin' the Bird\" was written for her, she replied, \"No. I don't know how that rumor got started.\"\n\n1960s\nIn the early 1960s, Jordan performed at the Page Three Club in Greenwich Village with pianist Herbie Nichols, and at other bars and clubs inNew York City. She withdrew from clubs for much of the '60s to raise her daughter, and sang in church instead. For 20 years, she worked as a typist and legal secretary with little time to concentrate on music until she was 58.\n\nIn 1962, she worked with George Russell, with whom she recorded the song, \"You Are My Sunshine\" on his album The Outer View (Riverside). Later that year she recorded the album Portrait of Sheila released by Blue Note. Her long working relationship with Steve Kuhn began in the early 1960s. She also played with Don Heckman (1967\u201368), Lee Konitz (1972), and Roswell Rudd (1972\u201375).\n\n1970s to present\nthumb|left|Sheila Jordan in 1985\nIn 1974, Jordan was Artist in Residence at City College of New York and taught there from 1978\u20132005. In 2006, she was presented the Manhattan Association of Cabarets & Clubs (MAC) Lifetime Achievement Award and celebrated 28 years as an adjunct professor of music. She has taught at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Vermont Jazz Center, Interplay Jazz and Arts, as well as teaching international workshops.\n\nOn July 12, 1975, she recorded Confirmation. One year later she released the duet album Sheila, with Arild Andersen for SteepleChase. In 1979, she founded a quartet with Steve Kuhn, Harvie S, and Bob Moses. During the 1980s, she worked with Harvie S as a duo and played on several records with him. Until 1987 she worked in an advertising agency and recorded Lost and Found in 1989.\n\nJordan is a songwriter who works in bebop and free jazz. In addition to the aforementioned musicians, she has recorded with the George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band, Cameron Brown, Carla Bley, and Steve Swallow. In the UK she appeared with former John Dankworth Band vocalist Frank Holder. She has led recordings for Blue Note, Blackhawk, East Wind, ECM, Grapevine, Muse, Palo Alto, and SteepleChase\n\nIn 2012, she received the NEA Jazz Masters Award.

In 1999, a friend who worked as an artist at a local game studio named BioWare (at that point having only recently achieved success with the release of Baldur's Gate) suggested to the studio founders, Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, that Gaider be given a newly-available position in the design department. Gaider got the job and, as his first assignment, was handed the task of writing for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.

        "text": "Dell David Bull (born 1965) is a retired United States Navy Rear Admiral and Naval Flight Officer bombardier/navigator currently assigned as Deputy Director for Operations and Intelligence Integration at the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO). He previously served as Special Assistant for Naval Air Systems Command in Washington, D.C. From July 2015 to June 2017, Bull was Chief of Naval Air Training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.\n\nEarly life and education\nDell Bull was born in 1965 in Oak Harbor, Washington, the son of Lyle and Diana ( Stone) Bull. Bull has three older brothers: Ron, Vince, and Bruce. At the time of Bull's birth, his father had recently separated from the United States Naval Reserve as a Naval Flight Officer Bombardier/Navigator and the family moved for a short period of time to East Moline, Illinois, to be near his parents' respective families. When the navy recruited Bull's father into active duty service in 1965, the family returned to Oak Harbor and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. He and his brothers attended school there, with Bull graduating from Oak Harbor High School in 1983. Following high school, Bull attended the University of Idaho in Moscow, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science.\n\nNavy career\nNaval Flight Officer\nFollowing college graduation and Officer Candidate School, Bull received a commission in the United States Navy as an ensign, designated a Naval Flight Officer (NFO) and received his wings in 1989. Bull was assigned to Grumman A-6 Intruder replacement aircrew training at NAS Whidbey Island with VA-128. Bull then received orders to VA-196, also at NAS Whidbey Island and one of the squadrons in which his father served during the Vietnam War, including as executive officer in 1974 when Bull was nine years old. Bull deployed with VA-196 aboard the , flying missions during Operation Desert Shield in 1990.\n\nFollowing Desert Shield and retirement of the A-6 Intruder, Bull selected to transition to the F-14 Tomcat. After replacement aircrew training, he was assigned to VF-101 as one of the first Radar Intercept Officers who had transitioned from another aircraft. Bull later served as an F-14 Replacement Air Group instructor. Following that assignment, he reported to VF-24 and deployed aboard the  to fly missions during Operation Southern Watch. After his tour with VF-24, Bull reported to VF-14 and deployed aboard the . While serving with VF-14, Bull was named Naval Flight Officer of the Year as a result of performance and tactical expertise while in combat.\n\nBull's flight record includes more than 4,800 flight hours and more than 950 arrested landings.\n\nShore duty\nBull's shore duty assignments have included: legislative fellow with Senator John McCain, Senior Policy officer with Homeland Security as part of the Joint Staff, J-34 Anti-Terrorism Office, Aviation Program Manager in the Office of Legislative Affairs, all in Washington, D.C. Bull has also served as chief of staff, Naval Air Force Pacific in San Diego, California, and chief of staff for the commander of the Naval Air Forces, in Washington, D.C.\n\nCommand assignments\nCommand operational assignments include the Strike Fighter Squadron VFA-41 Black Aces aboard , VFA-122 Flying Eagles, the west coast F/A-18A-F Fleet Replacement Squadron, and Carrier Air Wing 9 aboard . Bull assumed command of Chief of Naval Air Training in July 2015.\n\nDecorations, awards, promotions\nBull's decorations and awards include the Legion of Merit with two Gold Stars, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meritorious Service Medals, three Air Medals with the Combat \"V\", six Strike/Flight Medals, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a gold star, two Navy Achievement Medals, and various campaign, unit, and service awards.\n\nWhile at CNAF in San Diego, Captain Bull was promoted to rear admiral in April 2015.\n\nControversy\nIn July 2017, Bull was ordered to report to Washington, D.C., with RADM Jay Bynum taking his place as Chief of Naval Air Training at NAS Corpus Christi.  News reports referred to the change of command as \"sudden\".  The change of duty assignments followed the grounding of T-45 Goshawk training jets following safety issues with the cockpit oxygen systems in the aircraft.  After numerous reports of hazardous physical symptoms pilots were experiencing while flying the T-45 during training missions due to lack of oxygen, it was determined that contaminants were in the oxygen system.  As a result, pilot instructors were refusing to fly and the Navy's entire fleet of 200 training jets were grounded.  Instructors and trainees were reported as being dissatisfied with Bull's response to the issues as Chief of Naval Air Training.  According to news reports at the time, the pilots felt they were being told by Bull to stand down in their complaints and fly in spite of the unresolved safety issues.  Bull expressed his displeasure at the time that the issue had been made public.\n\nWhen Bull's reassignment was announced, change of command had already occurred.  At that time, Bull had written a letter to his staff that stated he was going to Washington, D.C., to lead a team which  would \"solve problems with Navy and Marine Corps fighter jets.\"\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1965 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:University of Idaho alumni\nCategory:United States Naval Flight Officers\nCategory:United States Navy rear admirals (lower half)",

        "text": "Denis Colin Leary (born August 18, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. Born in Massachusetts, Leary first came to prominence as a stand-up comedian, especially through appearances on MTV (including the comedic song \"Asshole\") and through the stand-up specials No Cure for Cancer (1993) and Lock 'n Load (1997). Leary began taking roles in film and television starting in the 1990s, including substantial roles in the films Judgment Night (1993), Gunmen (1994), Operation Dumbo Drop (1995) and Wag the Dog (1997).\n\nIn the 2000s, he developed and starred in the television show The Job (2001\u20132002) and was the star and co-creator of Rescue Me (2004\u20132011), for which he received three Primetime Emmy nominations, one for writing and two for acting. He has continued to take starring roles in films, including Captain George Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man and Cleveland Browns head coach Vince Penn in Draft Day. Leary has done voice work, including Francis in A Bug's Life and Diego in the Ice Age franchise.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2016, Leary wrote and starred in the comedy series Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll on FX.\n\nEarly life\nDenis Colin Leary was born on August 18, 1957, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Catholic immigrant parents from Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland. His mother, Nora (n\u00e9e Sullivan) (b. 1929), was a maid, and his father, John Leary (1924\u20131985), was an auto mechanic. Leary is a citizen of both the United States and Ireland. Leary is a third cousin of talk show host and fellow comedian Conan O'Brien.\n\nLeary attended Saint Peter's High School (now Saint Paul's) in Worcester and graduated from Emerson College in Boston. At Emerson, he befriended fellow comic Mario Cantone. While a student, Leary founded the Emerson Comedy Workshop, a troupe that continues on the campus today.\n\nAfter graduating from Emerson in 1981, Leary taught comedy-writing classes at the school for five years. In May 2005 he received an honorary doctorate and spoke at his alma mater's undergraduate commencement ceremony; and is credited as Dr. Denis Leary on the cover of his 2009 book Why We Suck.\n\nCareer\nLeary began working as a comedian at the Boston underground club Play It Again Sam's. His first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show The Rascals Comedy Hour, on October 18, 1990. He wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, Lenny Clarke's Late Show, hosted by his friend Lenny Clarke and written by Martin Olson. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film When Standup Stood Out (2006). During Leary's time as a Boston-area stand-up comic, he developed his stage persona.\n\nLeary appeared in sketches on the MTV game show Remote Control, playing characters such as Keith Richards, co-host Colin Quinn's brother and artist Andy Warhol.  He earned fame when he ranted about R.E.M. in an early 1990s MTV sketch. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing alternative scene. One of these rants served as an introduction to the video for \"Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)\" by House of Pain. Leary released two records of his comedy: No Cure for Cancer (1993) and Lock 'n Load (1997). In late 2004, he released the EP Merry F %$in' Christmas, which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings and some tracks from Lock 'n Load. \n\nIn 1993, Leary's sardonic song \"Asshole\", about the stereotypical American male, achieved much notoriety. The song was voted No. 1 in an Australian radio poll and was used in Holsten Pils ads in the UK, with Leary's participation, and with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver. The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1996.\n\nIn 1995, Leary was asked by Boston Bruins legend Cam Neely to help orchestrate a Boston-based comedy benefit show for Neely's cancer charity; this became Comics Come Home, which Leary has hosted annually ever since.SideTrack: Comics Come Home lineup announced. Boston Herald, August 15, 2018.

He had a role in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers that was eventually cut. He held the lead role in two television series, The Job and Rescue Me . He co-created the latter, in which he played Tommy Gavin, a New York City firefighter dealing with alcoholism, family dysfunction and other issues in post-9/11 New York City.\nLeary received Emmy Award nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Rescue Me, and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the HBO movie Recount. Leary was offered the role of Dignam in The Departed (2006) but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with Rescue Me. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series The Agents, a pugnacious ladybug named Francis in A Bug's Life and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named Diego in the Ice Age film series. He has produced numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include Comedy Central's Shorties Watchin' Shorties, the stand-up special Denis Leary's Merry F#$%in' Christmas and the movie Blow. \n\nAs a Boston Red Sox fan, Leary narrated the official 2004 World Series film. In 2006, Leary and Lenny Clarke appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson's antisemitic comments. As an ice hockey fan, Leary hosted the National Hockey League video NHL's Greatest Goals. In 2003, he was the subject of the Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary.\n\nLeary did the TV voiceover for MLB 2K8 advertisements, using his trademark rant style in baseball terms, and ads for the 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck. He has also appeared in commercials for Hulu and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package. Leary was a producer of the Fox series Canterbury's Law, and wrote and directed its pilot episode. Canterbury's Law aired in the spring of 2008 and was canceled after eight episodes. On September 9, 2008, Leary hosted the sixth annual Fashion Rocks event, which aired on CBS. In December of the year, he appeared in a video on funnyordie.com critiquing a list of some of his \"best\" films, titled \"Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies\". Also in 2008, Leary voiced a guest role as himself in The Simpsons episode \"Lost Verizon\".\n\nOn March 21, 2009, Leary began the Rescue Me Comedy Tour in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The 11-date tour, featuring Rescue Me co-stars Lenny Clarke and Adam Ferrara, was Leary's first stand-up comedy tour in 12 years. The Comedy Central special Douchebags and Donuts, filmed during the tour, debuted on American television on January 16, 2011, with a DVD release on January 18, 2011.\nthumb|Denis Leary at the BookExpo America in 2017\nLeary played Captain George Stacy in the movie The Amazing Spider-Man, released in July 2012. He wrote the American adaptation of Sirens. He is an executive producer of the documentary Burn, which chronicles the struggles of the Detroit Fire Department.

They met when he was her instructor in an English class at Emerson College. They have two children, son John Joseph \"Jack\" (born 1990) and daughter Devin (born 1992).Profile, The New York Times. Retrieved March 7, 2015. Ann Leary published a memoir, An Innocent, a Broad, about the premature birth of their son on a visit to London. She has also written a novel, Outtakes From a Marriage, which was published in 2008. Her second novel, The Good House, was published in 2013. Her essay in a New York Times column about her marriage to Denis inspired the Modern Love series Episode 4: \"Rallying to Keep the Game Alive\".\n\nLeary is an ice hockey fan and has a backyard rink at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, with piping installed under the ice surface to help it stay frozen. He is a fan of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Green Bay Packers.\n\nLeary describes himself as a \"Jack Kennedy Democrat\" with some conservative ideologies, including support for the military. Leary told Glenn Beck, \"I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the Republicans suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want.\"\n\nLeary has said of his religious beliefs, \"I'm a lapsed Catholic in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in Gaelic. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy....\"\n\nLeary is godfather to Damian Hurley, the son of actress Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nLeary Firefighters Foundation\n\nOn December 3, 1999, six firefighters from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey, as well as Leary's close childhood friend, Lt. Tommy Spencer. In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5\u00a0million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.\n\nA separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2\u00a0million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001, in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first-responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department's training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the New Orleans Fire Department to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.\n\nControversies\nPlagiarism\nFor many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. But when Leary's comedy album No Cure for Cancer was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks' act and material, ending their friendship abruptly. In April 1993, the Austin Comedy News remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance: \"Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx.\" When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, \"I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did\".\n\nAt least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude. One similar routine was about the so-called Judas Priest \"suicide trial,\" during which Hicks says, \"I don't think we lost a cancer cure.\"\n\nDuring Leary's 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, \"Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.\" This joke was cut from the final broadcast.\n\nThe feud is also mentioned in Cynthia True's biography American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story:\n\nAccording to the book, True said that upon hearing a tape of Leary's album No Cure for Cancer, \"Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and recorded it.\"\n\nIn a 2008 appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, comedian Louis C.K. claimed Leary stole his \"I'm an asshole\" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary. On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.\n\nAutism\nIn his 2008 book Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid, Leary wrote:\n\nLeary later stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about what he calls the trend of \"unwarranted\" over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.\n\nFilmography\n Comedy specials \n Year  Title  Role  Notes 1993  Denis Leary: No Cure for Cancer  Himself  Stand-up special 1997  Denis Leary: Lock 'N Loaded 2005  Merry F#%$in' Christmas  Christmas special 2011  Denis Leary & Friends Presents: Douchebags & Donuts  Stand-up special\n\nFilm\n Year  Title  Role  Notes1987Long Walk to ForeverNewtShort film1991Strictly BusinessJakeCameo1993BillWho's the Man?Sergeant CooperDemolition ManEdgar FriendlyLoaded Weapon 1Mike McCracken Cameo; performing \"You Really Got Me\"Judgment NightFallon1994GusGunmenArmor O'MalleyNatural Born KillersPrison InmateDirector's cut; cameo1995Operation Dumbo DropCW3 David PooleFrank1996UnderworldJohnny Crown/Johnny AltTwo If by SeaFrancis \"Frank\" O'BrienAlso writer1997Love Walked InJack HanawayAlso producerWag the DogFad KingSuicide KingsLono VeccioDougNick1998Monument Ave.Bobby O'Grady  a.k.a.

Born in Massachusetts, Leary first came to prominence as a stand-up comedian, especially through appearances on MTV (including the comedic song \"Asshole\") and through the stand-up specials No Cure for Cancer (1993) and Lock 'n Load (1997). Leary began taking roles in film and television starting in the 1990s, including substantial roles in the films Judgment Night (1993), Gunmen (1994), Operation Dumbo Drop (1995) and Wag the Dog (1997).\n\nIn the 2000s, he developed and starred in the television show The Job (2001\u20132002) and was the star and co-creator of Rescue Me (2004\u20132011), for which he received three Primetime Emmy nominations, one for writing and two for acting. He has continued to take starring roles in films, including Captain George Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man and Cleveland Browns head coach Vince Penn in Draft Day. Leary has done voice work, including Francis in A Bug's Life and Diego in the Ice Age franchise.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2016, Leary wrote and starred in the comedy series Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll on FX.\n\nEarly life\nDenis Colin Leary was born on August 18, 1957, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Catholic immigrant parents from Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland. His mother, Nora (n\u00e9e Sullivan) (b. 1929), was a maid, and his father, John Leary (1924\u20131985), was an auto mechanic. Leary is a citizen of both the United States and Ireland. Leary is a third cousin of talk show host and fellow comedian Conan O'Brien.\n\nLeary attended Saint Peter's High School (now Saint Paul's) in Worcester and graduated from Emerson College in Boston. At Emerson, he befriended fellow comic Mario Cantone. While a student, Leary founded the Emerson Comedy Workshop, a troupe that continues on the campus today.\n\nAfter graduating from Emerson in 1981, Leary taught comedy-writing classes at the school for five years. In May 2005 he received an honorary doctorate and spoke at his alma mater's undergraduate commencement ceremony; and is credited as Dr. Denis Leary on the cover of his 2009 book Why We Suck.\n\nCareer\nLeary began working as a comedian at the Boston underground club Play It Again Sam's. His first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show The Rascals Comedy Hour, on October 18, 1990. He wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, Lenny Clarke's Late Show, hosted by his friend Lenny Clarke and written by Martin Olson. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film When Standup Stood Out (2006). During Leary's time as a Boston-area stand-up comic, he developed his stage persona.\n\nLeary appeared in sketches on the MTV game show Remote Control, playing characters such as Keith Richards, co-host Colin Quinn's brother and artist Andy Warhol.  He earned fame when he ranted about R.E.M. in an early 1990s MTV sketch. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing alternative scene. One of these rants served as an introduction to the video for \"Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)\" by House of Pain. Leary released two records of his comedy: No Cure for Cancer (1993) and Lock 'n Load (1997). In late 2004, he released the EP Merry F %$in' Christmas, which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings and some tracks from Lock 'n Load. \n\nIn 1993, Leary's sardonic song \"Asshole\", about the stereotypical American male, achieved much notoriety. The song was voted No. 1 in an Australian radio poll and was used in Holsten Pils ads in the UK, with Leary's participation, and with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver. The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1996.\n\nIn 1995, Leary was asked by Boston Bruins legend Cam Neely to help orchestrate a Boston-based comedy benefit show for Neely's cancer charity; this became Comics Come Home, which Leary has hosted annually ever since.SideTrack: Comics Come Home lineup announced.

He had a role in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers that was eventually cut. He held the lead role in two television series, The Job and Rescue Me . He co-created the latter, in which he played Tommy Gavin, a New York City firefighter dealing with alcoholism, family dysfunction and other issues in post-9/11 New York City.\nLeary received Emmy Award nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Rescue Me, and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the HBO movie Recount. Leary was offered the role of Dignam in The Departed (2006) but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with Rescue Me. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series The Agents, a pugnacious ladybug named Francis in A Bug's Life and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named Diego in the Ice Age film series. He has produced numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include Comedy Central's Shorties Watchin' Shorties, the stand-up special Denis Leary's Merry F#$%in' Christmas and the movie Blow. \n\nAs a Boston Red Sox fan, Leary narrated the official 2004 World Series film. In 2006, Leary and Lenny Clarke appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson's antisemitic comments. As an ice hockey fan, Leary hosted the National Hockey League video NHL's Greatest Goals. In 2003, he was the subject of the Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary.\n\nLeary did the TV voiceover for MLB 2K8 advertisements, using his trademark rant style in baseball terms, and ads for the 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck. He has also appeared in commercials for Hulu and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package. Leary was a producer of the Fox series Canterbury's Law, and wrote and directed its pilot episode. Canterbury's Law aired in the spring of 2008 and was canceled after eight episodes. On September 9, 2008, Leary hosted the sixth annual Fashion Rocks event, which aired on CBS. In December of the year, he appeared in a video on funnyordie.com critiquing a list of some of his \"best\" films, titled \"Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies\". Also in 2008, Leary voiced a guest role as himself in The Simpsons episode \"Lost Verizon\".\n\nOn March 21, 2009, Leary began the Rescue Me Comedy Tour in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The 11-date tour, featuring Rescue Me co-stars Lenny Clarke and Adam Ferrara, was Leary's first stand-up comedy tour in 12 years. The Comedy Central special Douchebags and Donuts, filmed during the tour, debuted on American television on January 16, 2011, with a DVD release on January 18, 2011.\nthumb|Denis Leary at the BookExpo America in 2017\nLeary played Captain George Stacy in the movie The Amazing Spider-Man, released in July 2012.

The show ran for two seasons.\n\nIn 2022, he was cast in the recurring role of Frank Donnelly, an NYPD officer on Law & Order: Organized Crime.\n\nLeary has been the narrator for NESN's documentary show about the Boston Bruins called Behind the B since the show began in 2013.\n\nPersonal life\nthumb|right|Leary and his wife Ann Lembeck at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival\nLeary has been married to author Ann Lembeck Leary since 1989. They met when he was her instructor in an English class at Emerson College. They have two children, son John Joseph \"Jack\" (born 1990) and daughter Devin (born 1992).Profile, The New York Times. Retrieved March 7, 2015. Ann Leary published a memoir, An Innocent, a Broad, about the premature birth of their son on a visit to London. She has also written a novel, Outtakes From a Marriage, which was published in 2008. Her second novel, The Good House, was published in 2013. Her essay in a New York Times column about her marriage to Denis inspired the Modern Love series Episode 4: \"Rallying to Keep the Game Alive\".\n\nLeary is an ice hockey fan and has a backyard rink at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, with piping installed under the ice surface to help it stay frozen. He is a fan of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Green Bay Packers.\n\nLeary describes himself as a \"Jack Kennedy Democrat\" with some conservative ideologies, including support for the military. Leary told Glenn Beck, \"I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the Republicans suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want.\"\n\nLeary has said of his religious beliefs, \"I'm a lapsed Catholic in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in Gaelic. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy....\"\n\nLeary is godfather to Damian Hurley, the son of actress Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nLeary Firefighters Foundation\n\nOn December 3, 1999, six firefighters from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey, as well as Leary's close childhood friend, Lt. Tommy Spencer. In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5\u00a0million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.\n\nA separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2\u00a0million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001, in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first-responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department's training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the New Orleans Fire Department to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.\n\nControversies\nPlagiarism\nFor many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. But when Leary's comedy album No Cure for Cancer was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks' act and material, ending their friendship abruptly. In April 1993, the Austin Comedy News remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance: \"Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx.\" When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, \"I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did\".\n\nAt least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude. One similar routine was about the so-called Judas Priest \"suicide trial,\" during which Hicks says, \"I don't think we lost a cancer cure.\"\n\nDuring Leary's 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, \"Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.\" This joke was cut from the final broadcast.\n\nThe feud is also mentioned in Cynthia True's biography American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story:\n\nAccording to the book, True said that upon hearing a tape of Leary's album No Cure for Cancer, \"Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and recorded it.\"\n\nIn a 2008 appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, comedian Louis C.K. claimed Leary stole his \"I'm an asshole\" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary. On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.\n\nAutism\nIn his 2008 book Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid, Leary wrote:\n\nLeary later stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about what he calls the trend of \"unwarranted\" over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.\n\nFilmography\n Comedy specials \n Year  Title  Role  Notes 1993  Denis Leary: No Cure for Cancer  Himself  Stand-up special 1997  Denis Leary: Lock 'N Loaded 2005  Merry F#%$in' Christmas  Christmas special 2011  Denis Leary & Friends Presents: Douchebags & Donuts  Stand-up special\n\nFilm\n Year  Title  Role  Notes1987Long Walk to ForeverNewtShort film1991Strictly BusinessJakeCameo1993BillWho's the Man?Sergeant CooperDemolition ManEdgar FriendlyLoaded Weapon 1Mike McCracken Cameo; performing \"You Really Got Me\"Judgment NightFallon1994GusGunmenArmor O'MalleyNatural Born KillersPrison InmateDirector's cut; cameo1995Operation Dumbo DropCW3 David PooleFrank1996UnderworldJohnny Crown/Johnny AltTwo If by SeaFrancis \"Frank\" O'BrienAlso writer1997Love Walked InJack HanawayAlso producerWag the DogFad KingSuicide KingsLono VeccioDougNick1998Monument Ave.Bobby O'Grady  a.k.a.

Leary was offered the role of Dignam in The Departed (2006) but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with Rescue Me. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series The Agents, a pugnacious ladybug named Francis in A Bug's Life and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named Diego in the Ice Age film series. He has produced numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include Comedy Central's Shorties Watchin' Shorties, the stand-up special Denis Leary's Merry F#$%in' Christmas and the movie Blow. \n\nAs a Boston Red Sox fan, Leary narrated the official 2004 World Series film. In 2006, Leary and Lenny Clarke appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson's antisemitic comments. As an ice hockey fan, Leary hosted the National Hockey League video NHL's Greatest Goals. In 2003, he was the subject of the Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary.\n\nLeary did the TV voiceover for MLB 2K8 advertisements, using his trademark rant style in baseball terms, and ads for the 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck. He has also appeared in commercials for Hulu and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package. Leary was a producer of the Fox series Canterbury's Law, and wrote and directed its pilot episode. Canterbury's Law aired in the spring of 2008 and was canceled after eight episodes. On September 9, 2008, Leary hosted the sixth annual Fashion Rocks event, which aired on CBS. In December of the year, he appeared in a video on funnyordie.com critiquing a list of some of his \"best\" films, titled \"Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies\". Also in 2008, Leary voiced a guest role as himself in The Simpsons episode \"Lost Verizon\".\n\nOn March 21, 2009, Leary began the Rescue Me Comedy Tour in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The 11-date tour, featuring Rescue Me co-stars Lenny Clarke and Adam Ferrara, was Leary's first stand-up comedy tour in 12 years. The Comedy Central special Douchebags and Donuts, filmed during the tour, debuted on American television on January 16, 2011, with a DVD release on January 18, 2011.\nthumb|Denis Leary at the BookExpo America in 2017\nLeary played Captain George Stacy in the movie The Amazing Spider-Man, released in July 2012. He wrote the American adaptation of Sirens. He is an executive producer of the documentary Burn, which chronicles the struggles of the Detroit Fire Department. Burn won the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award.\n\nLeary created a television series for FX called Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, taking the starring role himself. A 10-episode first season was ordered by FX, with the premiere on July 16, 2015. The show ran for two seasons.\n\nIn 2022, he was cast in the recurring role of Frank Donnelly, an NYPD officer on Law & Order: Organized Crime.\n\nLeary has been the narrator for NESN's documentary show about the Boston Bruins called Behind the B since the show began in 2013.\n\nPersonal life\nthumb|right|Leary and his wife Ann Lembeck at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival\nLeary has been married to author Ann Lembeck Leary since 1989. They met when he was her instructor in an English class at Emerson College. They have two children, son John Joseph \"Jack\" (born 1990) and daughter Devin (born 1992).Profile, The New York Times. Retrieved March 7, 2015. Ann Leary published a memoir, An Innocent, a Broad, about the premature birth of their son on a visit to London. She has also written a novel, Outtakes From a Marriage, which was published in 2008. Her second novel, The Good House, was published in 2013. Her essay in a New York Times column about her marriage to Denis inspired the Modern Love series Episode 4: \"Rallying to Keep the Game Alive\".\n\nLeary is an ice hockey fan and has a backyard rink at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, with piping installed under the ice surface to help it stay frozen. He is a fan of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Green Bay Packers.\n\nLeary describes himself as a \"Jack Kennedy Democrat\" with some conservative ideologies, including support for the military. Leary told Glenn Beck, \"I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the Republicans suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want.\"\n\nLeary has said of his religious beliefs, \"I'm a lapsed Catholic in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in Gaelic. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy....\"\n\nLeary is godfather to Damian Hurley, the son of actress Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nLeary Firefighters Foundation\n\nOn December 3, 1999, six firefighters from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey, as well as Leary's close childhood friend, Lt. Tommy Spencer. In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5\u00a0million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.\n\nA separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2\u00a0million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001, in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first-responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department's training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the New Orleans Fire Department to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.\n\nControversies\nPlagiarism\nFor many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. But when Leary's comedy album No Cure for Cancer was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks' act and material, ending their friendship abruptly. In April 1993, the Austin Comedy News remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance: \"Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx.\" When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, \"I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did\".\n\nAt least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude. One similar routine was about the so-called Judas Priest \"suicide trial,\" during which Hicks says, \"I don't think we lost a cancer cure.\"\n\nDuring Leary's 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, \"Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.\" This joke was cut from the final broadcast.\n\nThe feud is also mentioned in Cynthia True's biography American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story:\n\nAccording to the book, True said that upon hearing a tape of Leary's album No Cure for Cancer, \"Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and recorded it.\"\n\nIn a 2008 appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, comedian Louis C.K. claimed Leary stole his \"I'm an asshole\" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary. On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.\n\nAutism\nIn his 2008 book Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid, Leary wrote:\n\nLeary later stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about what he calls the trend of \"unwarranted\" over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.\n\nFilmography\n Comedy specials \n Year  Title  Role  Notes 1993  Denis Leary: No Cure for Cancer  Himself  Stand-up special 1997  Denis Leary: Lock 'N Loaded 2005  Merry F#%$in' Christmas  Christmas special 2011  Denis Leary & Friends Presents: Douchebags & Donuts  Stand-up special\n\nFilm\n Year  Title  Role  Notes1987Long Walk to ForeverNewtShort film1991Strictly BusinessJakeCameo1993BillWho's the Man?Sergeant CooperDemolition ManEdgar FriendlyLoaded Weapon 1Mike McCracken Cameo; performing \"You Really Got Me\"Judgment NightFallon1994GusGunmenArmor O'MalleyNatural Born KillersPrison InmateDirector's cut; cameo1995Operation Dumbo DropCW3 David PooleFrank1996UnderworldJohnny Crown/Johnny AltTwo If by SeaFrancis \"Frank\" O'BrienAlso writer1997Love Walked InJack HanawayAlso producerWag the DogFad KingSuicide KingsLono VeccioDougNick1998Monument Ave.Bobby O'Grady  a.k.a.

        "text": "M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi (; ; born August 29, 1942) is a Romanian-Hungarian-American gymnastics coach and the former national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics. She and her husband, B\u00e9la, are ethnic Hungarians from Transylvania, Romania, who trained athletes in Romania, including  Nadia Com\u0103neci, before defecting to the United States in 1981. B\u00e9la and M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi have trained nine Olympic champions, fifteen world champions, sixteen European medalists and many U.S. national champions, including Com\u0103neci, Mary Lou Retton, Betty Okino, Kerri Strug, Teodora Ungureanu, Phoebe Mills, Kim Zmeskal, and Dominique Moceanu.\n\nRomania\nRomania's famed centralized training program has its roots in the 1950s; the K\u00e1rolyis helped develop the program further in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They established a boarding school in One\u015fti, training young girls specially chosen for their athletic potential. One of the first students at the K\u00e1rolyis' school was six-year-old Nadia Com\u0103neci, who lived near One\u015fti and commuted from home.\n\nWhile B\u00e9la became a highly visible figure in Romanian gymnastics, accompanying the team to major competitions and often clashing with officials in the sport, M\u00e1rta remained in the background, coaching and choreographing routines for some of the team's gymnasts.\n\nIn 1981, the K\u00e1rolyis, along with fellow Hungarian-Romanian team choreographer G\u00e9za Pozs\u00e1r, defected during a gymnastics tour in the United States. They were granted asylum and settled in Oklahoma. The couple's daughter, Andrea, joined them later.\n\n1980s and 1990s\nAfter their defection, the K\u00e1rolyis established a gym in Houston, Texas. B\u00e9la's status as \"Nadia's coach\" quickly attracted gymnasts to the club, and by the late 1980s, the K\u00e1rolyi gym had become the preeminent training facility in the United States. By 1990, K\u00e1rolyi gymnasts were so dominant at national United States meets that journalists dubbed the top cluster of athletes the \"K\u00e1rolyi six-pack\". At the 1991 World Championships, every single gymnast on the American squad was either a K\u00e1rolyi athlete or trained by a former K\u00e1rolyi club coach.\n\nM\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi has avoided most of the controversy and accusations of abusive coaching that have trailed her husband, opting for a quieter, less abrasive approach. In the K\u00e1rolyi coaching team, B\u00e9la was often known as the \"motivator,\" while M\u00e1rta was the \"technician,\" applying her gymnastics savvy to help her athletes learn and perfect their technique, mechanics, and form. B\u00e9la accompanied the gymnasts to meets and was a highly visible presence to both the gymnastics community and the media; M\u00e1rta remained in the background.\n\nIn 1996, M\u00e1rta was chosen as the head coach of the U.S. women's team for the 1996 Olympics.\n\nU.S. National Team Coordinator\nAfter the 1996 Olympics, the K\u00e1rolyis retired from coaching. However, three years later, B\u00e9la returned to the public eye when he was named the national team coordinator for the U.S. women's gymnastics team. His approach was protested and resisted by both the national-team gymnasts and their coaches, who, by the 2000 Olympics, were so frustrated and unhappy that they spoke about the situation publicly.\n\nIn 2001, on the recommendation of the U.S. national team coaches, the position was handed over to M\u00e1rta. While she maintained some aspects of B\u00e9la's original program, her approach was different, and generally more acceptable to the gymnasts and their coaches. It also yielded impressive competitive results: between 2001 and 2008, American women  won a combined total of 44 medals in World Championship and Olympic competition.\n\nAs coordinator, M\u00e1rta oversaw all aspects of the women's national team. Among her duties were selecting athletes for competitions, determining apparatus lineups at the meets, and making recommendations about skills and routine compositions. The K\u00e1rolyis' daughter, Andrea, was the nutritionist for the team.\n\nAt the 2012 Olympics, after Aly Raisman was given a score of 14.966 in the balance beam final, which put her a tenth of a point behind C\u0103t\u0103lina Ponor of Romania, K\u00e1rolyi requested a video review. As a result of the review, Raisman was awarded an additional tenth of a point for difficulty, allowing her to win the bronze medal on a tie breaker.\n\nShe retired from coaching in 2016, after the Olympics at which the US Women Gymnastics Team won nine medals (four gold, four silver, one bronze). Her last group of gymnasts called themselves the Final Five because that was M\u00e1rta's last Olympics. Valeri Liukin was named as her replacement on 16 September 2016.\n\nIn 2021, the Karolyi ranch was sold to a lumber company. The Karolyis retreated from the public eye after the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal and their whereabouts are unknown, with some speculating that they returned to Romania.\n\nHer husband B\u00e9la died on November 15, 2024, at the age of 82.\n\nControversy\nIn November 2008, Emilia Eberle, a Romanian national team member during the K\u00e1rolyi coaching era, gave an interview to KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California, claiming that while she was on the team, both B\u00e9la and M\u00e1rta regularly beat her and her teammates for mistakes they made in practice or competition. \"In one word, I can say it was brutal\", she told KCRA. Other Romanian team members, including Ecaterina Szabo and Rodica Dunca, as well as G\u00e9za Pozs\u00e1r, the Romanian team choreographer who defected with the K\u00e1rolyis, have made similar charges of physical abuse. When asked in 2008 to comment on the allegations, B\u00e9la K\u00e1rolyi said: \"I ignore it. I'm not even commenting. These people are really trash.\"\n\nOn October 28, 2016, a sex abuse lawsuit was filed by a former member gymnast against USA Gymnastics including the K\u00e1rolyis, alleging they turned a blind eye to molestations by the team doctor Larry Nassar. The former member claims Nassar repeatedly sexually abused her when she was on the national team from 2006\u201311.\n\nIn January 2018, USA Gymnastics terminated its lease of the K\u00e1rolyi owned gymnastics training center Karolyi Ranch during the sentencing phase of the trial of Nassar, who was found guilty of numerous acts of sexual assault against young gymnasts, many of which took place at the facility, where parents were not allowed to be present. A lawsuit was filed against the K\u00e1rolyis in 2016 alleging that they had known about and \"turned a blind-eye to the sexual abuse\".\n\nOn January 25, 2018, the Ranch announced the permanent closure of the facility on its website. The Karolyis and their ranch are central figures in 2020 film, Athlete A - a documentary about the scandal. On January 30, 2018, the Texas Ranger Division took over the criminal investigation of the ranch.\n\nBibliography\nRyan, Joan. Little Girls in Pretty Boxes.

        "text": "Haricharan Seshadri, known mononymously as Haricharan (born 20 March 1987), is an Indian Carnatic vocalist, playback singer, and musician who predominantly works in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada music and cinema. He sang 2000 songs in films and albums. \n\nHe recorded his first Tamil film song for the film Kaadhal, in Joshua Sridhar's music when he was 17, and went on to record three songs in his debut movie. His song \"Unakkena Iruppen\" was nominated for the National Film Awards in 2005 which became widely popular. However he became popular only after his rendition to the song, \"Thuli Thuli\", composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja for the movie Paiyaa (2010).\n\nBackground\nHaricharan comes from Tamil music family from Chennai, India . His grandfather P. S. Ganapathy was an organiser of mic-less Carnatic concerts in the 60s under the name \"Aalapanaa\", and his grandmother Smt. Alamelu Ganapathy is a national awardee in Mathematics, and has been in academia for more than 35 years. His father G. Seshadri is an artist through AIR, and a bank employee, and his mother Latha, a librarian in P. S. Senior Secondary School. Haricharan started learning Carnatic music at an early age of seven under Smt. Sethu Mahadevan, and then from stalwarts like K. V. Narayanaswamy, T. M. Prabhavathi and P. S. Narayanaswamy.\n\nHe recorded his first Tamil film song for the film Kaadhal, in Joshua Sridhar's music when he was 17, and went on to record three songs in his debut movie. His song \"Unakkena Iruppen\" was nominated for the National Film Awards in 2005 which became widely popular. Since then he has recorded several hit numbers for various music directors across the south, predominantly in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam languages. He became more famous after his more recent song, \"Thuli Thuli\". Haricharan is one of the most used singers in Yuvan Shankar Raja's music. He has also sung Rotaract Change Anthem for RI Dist 3230.\n\nIn 2012, Haricharan sang alongside Rajinikanth for the song \"Maattram Ondrudhaan Maradhadhu\" from soundtrack of Kochadaiiyaan, which was composed by A. R. Rahman and released in 2014.\n\nAwards\nWon\nFilmfare Awards South\n2015 - Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer \u2013 Malayalam - Banglore Days\n2024 - Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer \u2013 Tamil - Ponniyin Selvan: II\n\nIIFA Utsavam\n2016 -IIFA Utsavam Award for Best Playback Singer - Male - Telugu - Baahubali\n2016 - IIFA Utsavam Award for Best Playback Singer - Male - Tamil - Baahubali\n2017- IIFA Utsavam Award for Best Playback Singer - Male - Telugu -Krishnagadi Veera premagadha\t\nAsianet Film Awards\n2015-Best Playback singer - Banglore Days\n\nDiscography\n\n Tamil Discography \n+YearFilmSongComposerCo-Singer(s)2004Kaadhal\"Unakkena Iruppaen\"Joshua Sridhar\"Thottu Thottu\"Harini Sudhakar\"Kaadhal\"2005February 14\"Idhu Kadhala\"Bharadwaj6\u2032.2\u2033\"Nee Otha Inchu\"D.

This led to her removal from the Alaska Human Rights Commission by Governor Mike Dunleavy. \n\nHer opposition to COVID-19 measures, like mask mandates, further polarized public opinion in the liberal areas outside her district, but her views were accepted by her constituents. These actions led to a recall effort by Anchorage residents in 2021, citing her controversial statements and perceived failure to represent constituents.

        "text": "Pedro Miguel de Santana Lopes  (; born 29 June 1956) is a Portuguese lawyer and politician, who is the current mayor of Figueira da Foz. He most notably served as prime minister of Portugal from 2004 to 2005.\n\nBackground and early life\n\nPedro Santana Lopes was born in Campo Grande, Lisbon, to An\u00edbal Lu\u00eds Lopes (b. Lisbon, S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o da Pedreira, 17 February 1933), a company administrator whose maternal grandfather's maternal grandfather was a relative of Jo\u00e3o Brand\u00e3o,Ra\u00edzes e Mem\u00f3rias, Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Genealogia, Lisboa and wife (m. Lisbon, S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o da Pedreira, 27 February 1954) Maria Ivone Risques Pereira de Santana (Lisbon, S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o da Pedreira, 3 May 1931 \u2013 Lisbon, 23 March 1999), a half-great-great-great-niece of the 2nd Baron of Brissos.\n\nHe graduated as a Licentiate in law from the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon, where he was the leader of the Student Union, becoming a lawyer.\n\nPolitical career\n\nHe joined the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 1976. There he started his career as a deputy to the Assembly of the Republic.\n\nIn 1979, he became a legal advisor to Prime Minister Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro, and has identified himself as a follower of his for all his political life.\n\nIn 1986, he became the assistant state secretary to Prime Minister An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, an office he left the next year to lead to PSD list to the European Parliament, where he remained for two years of his five-year-term.\n\nIn 1990, Cavaco Silva appointed him to the government post of Secretary of State for Culture. He left the office in 1994, in disagreement with Cavaco, and returned to law practice. In the 1997 local elections, he ran successfully to become mayor of Figueira da Foz. He decided not to seek a second term there, and instead ran for mayor of Lisbon in the 2001 local elections, defeating the incumbent Jo\u00e3o Soares and becoming one of the biggest surprises of the electoral night.\n\nPrime minister\n\nWhen Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso resigned in July 2004 to take up the presidency of the European Commission, Santana Lopes became the president of PSD. At the time, his party had a coalition government with the CDS - People's Party, which held a parliamentary majority, and therefore he was nominated prime minister of the XVI Constitutional Government. His term as mayor of Lisbon was automatically suspended, with his deputy Carmona Rodrigues taking over his duties.\n\nThe leadership of Santana Lopes was marked by a number of inherited economic and political problems. When his party took power, after the 2002 legislative elections, the country's economy was in a poor state, with a rising government-spending deficit, partially because of policies focused on public expenditure by the previous governments (led by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres of the Socialist Party) and the early 2000s recession. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, \"Portugal became the first country to breach the EU's 'excessive deficit' rule with a budget deficit of 4.4% of GDP in 2001, well above the 3% of GDP ceiling set by the EU's Stability and Growth Pact.\"Economist Intelligence Unit, 11 January 2005 The situation inherited by Santana Lopes was a little better, as the previous government led by Barroso had been able to comply with European Union directives regarding the deficit by selling state assets.\n\nSantana Lopes himself failed to gain a reputation as a competent prime minister. His unusual rise to power, as Barroso's successor rather than by election, contributed to these difficulties, despite his nomination being entirely constitutional.\n\nThe short career of Santana Lopes as prime minister began with some members of government being shuffled between departments on the same afternoon as the government was being inaugurated. His minister of Defence Paulo Portas looked surprised during the ceremony when he was announced as the Minister for National Defence and Sea Affairs. Portas' look of surprise when the name of his office was announced was broadcast live on television.\n\nSantana Lopes' period in office was also marked by chaos in the allocation of teachers to schools (more than a month after classes officially started, and resulting from alleged incompetence of the IT provider (designated during the previous Government); the problem was swiftly solved by another small provider), and by claims of pressure exerted on the press, including arranging for the replacement of the information director of the public television channel RTP, and pressing private television channel TVI to tone down the criticism of him by a political commentator, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, a former leader of his own party, who consequently left the channel.\n\nSantana Lopes' demise as head of government was sealed on 30 November 2004 when President Jorge Sampaio, a member of the opposing party, announced that he was calling an early Parliament election for February 2005, from which a new government would be formed, after Henrique Chaves, a Santana loyalist, resigned after four days as Minister for Sport, claiming that he lacked \"loyalty and truth\".\n\nSantana Lopes formally tendered his resignation on 11 December, and his government assumed just a caretaker role until the election. He went on to be defeated in the 2005 legislative elections which was won by the Socialist Party led by Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates. Santana resigned as party leader two days later, although he still briefly assumed the informal position of leader of the opposition, until the election of Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes as new party leader.\n\nSubsequent career and activities\n\nDespite his defeat in the 2005 legislative elections, Santana Lopes retained his seat at the Assembly of the Republic. He would also resume his functions as mayor of Lisbon, which had been suspended since he took office as prime minister. However, he decided not to seek another term on the 2005 local elections, being succeeded by his deputy, Carmona Rodrigues, who had also replaced him during his premiership. In October 2007, after the election of Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes as leader of the Social Democratic Party, he was invited to lead the PSD Parliamentary Group, a position he held until Menezes' resignation in June 2008.\n\nOn the 2009 local elections, Santana Lopes ran again for mayor of Lisbon, supported by his party and by the CDS - People's Party, the Earth Party and the People's Monarchist Party. This coalition was, however, unable to prevent the Socialist Party, led by Ant\u00f3nio Costa, to achieve a big victory. Santana Lopes assumed the position of leader of the opposition in the municipality.\n\nIn September 2011, Santana Lopes was nominated by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho to assume leadership of Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa, a charity that runs Portugal's national lottery. In March 2016, the new prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, nominated Santana Lopes for a new term.\n\nIn October 2017, Santana Lopes announced the intention to run again for the leadership of the Social Democratic Party.Paul Ames (12 January 2018), Thomson and Thompson battle for control of Portuguese right Politico Europe. He resigned leadership of Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa in order to do so, but was defeated by Rui Rio. After the party election, both Rio and Santana tried to cooperate on several levels, an effort which was not successful from Santana's point of view. He grew increasingly disgruntled with the course of action imposed by Rui Rio, and in June 2018 announced he would be ending his 42 years of party membership and would seek to create a new political party.\n\nAlliance (2018\u20132021)\n\nOn 18 August 2018, it was revealed the new party headed and co-founded by Santana Lopes was to be called Alliance (). The party submitted the legally required paperwork to the Constitutional Court and was officially registered on 23 October.\n\nImmediately after the official registration, the party started working on the campaign for the 2019 European Parliament election. Santana Lopes had already said, even before the party was registered, that he would not be running in the election, and that its top candidate would be announced in the near future. On 2 December 2018, the party formally announced Paulo de Almeida Sande, a professor of European affairs and advisor of the president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, as its top candidate. While being generally considered to have a profound knowledge of European issues, Paulo Sande lacked recognition next to the general public, and relied heavily on Santana's personal popularity to engage with supporters and potential voters. In March 2019, Santana Lopes said that the party's objective would be to elect at least one MEP, with three being a good result. Paulo Sande fared well in the televised debates, but the party suffered a heavy blow to its campaign on 15 May 2019, when Santana and Sande were involved in a car crash on the A1 motorway. They were heading to a campaign rally in Cascais after an event in Coimbra when, between Soure and Pombal, Santana fell asleep and lost control of the vehicle, a Lexus GS rented in name of his law firm. The car slid slowly to the left, hitting the central reservation barrier and veering abruptly to the right, crashing out of the road and tumbling several times before coming to a standstill in an overturned position. No other vehicles were involved in the accident, but other drivers witnessed it and alerted the emergency services. Paulo Sande was able to get out of the wrecked car by his own means; he tried to help Santana but was unable to release him. Santana Lopes would only be removed from the wreckage by the emergency services, and was transported by helicopter to Coimbra hospital, to where Sande was also taken on an ambulance. The accident was reported by several media outlets, which prompted Alliance to immediately suspend its campaign. Paulo Sande suffered only minor injuries and was discharged from the hospital a few hours later, while Santana spent the night in observation, being discharged on the next day after several exams revealed no significant lesions; he was, however, told by doctors to rest for some days in order to ensure a full recovery. This meant that, with little more than a week to the election day, Paulo Sande was largely left to campaign alone, although Santana appeared on a video three days before the election to urge people to vote. The party obtained 1,86% of the vote and elected no MEPs.\n\nNext on the schedule were the 2019 legislative elections. The party made a campaign of clear opposition to the incumbent government led by Ant\u00f3nio Costa. Santana Lopes said that Alliance hoped to elect two to three MPs in Lisbon district, and eventually some more in Porto and Braga districts; he also stressed that his party would never support a government of the Socialist Party even in the event of a hung parliament. Santana's predictions for the election were based at the party's results in the European elections. During a campaign event in Lisbon, he told that Alliance obtained 3% in the district at the European elections, and that the same result would allow the party to elect two MPs in the legislative vote. This line of thought proved to be flawed as the party performed considerably worse, obtaining only 0,77% of the vote on national level and electing no MPs. Even on Lisbon district, where is easier for a small party to elect a MP, the party scored 1,27% of the vote, considerably lower than the 3% anticipated by Santana. On the election night, he admitted for the first time that he could relinquish party leadership.\n\nWithout further national elections in the near future, and with all the objectives unachieved, Santana Lopes suspended his executive functions as Alliance's leader on 15 May 2020, and announced a period of reorganisation of the party. On 28 August 2020, it was announced that he would not seek re-election as party leader at the next congress, where he was succeeded by Paulo Bento. On 25 January 2021, Alliance announced that Santana Lopes had sent a request for his party membership to be terminated. He considered that Alliance could only have a future without him, citing the fact that many people still link him to the Social Democratic Party as the main reason.\n\nIndependent politician and return to Figueira da Foz\n\nAfter Santana's announcement that he was leaving Alliance leadership, rumours started circulating that he could be preparing a return to the Social Democratic Party. In October 2020, at least one media outlet reported that its leader, Rui Rio, wanted Santana Lopes to be the party candidate for mayor of Sintra; in March 2021, it was reported that he had declined to be the party candidate for mayor of Torres Vedras. His return to the Social Democratic Party was ruled out when it became known, in late March 2021, that he was seeking to create a citizen's group in order to run for mayor of Figueira da Foz, a position he held between 1998 and 2001. His candidacy, leading a list called Figueira The First (), was confirmed in May and generated significant interest, with opinion polls giving him real chances of winning. The candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Pedro Machado, launched on 10 August a legal action to invalidate Santana's candidacy due to alleged irregularities in its submission, which was rejected by the local court three days later.\n\nFigueira a Primeira would effectively become the winner, obtaining 40,39% and four councillors, against 38,39% for the Socialist Party, also with four councillors. The Social Democratic Party scored 10,83%, electing only one councillor. Under Portuguese law, the top candidate of the most voted list automatically becomes the mayor, but Santana will have to negotiate with other political groups in order to implement his agenda, since he didn't won a majority. He nevertheless considered the result \"an extraordinary accomplishment\".\n\nSantana Lopes took office as mayor of Figueira da Foz on 17 October 2021. On his inauguration speech, he announced to have reached a deal with the University of Coimbra to build a campus on Figueira da Foz, dedicated to marine economy and sciences. The campus opened on 20 December 2022.\n\nOn 20 April 2023, and without explicitly assuming a candidacy, Santana Lopes entertained the possibility of being a candidate for President of Portugal on the next election, saying that he saw no one better qualified than himself. However, he placed himself definitely out of the race on 19 October 2023, few days after the outbreak of the Israel\u2013Hamas war, citing the current state of world affairs as the main reason.\n\nOn 21 January 2024, Pedro Santana Lopes attended a convention of the Democratic Alliance, a coalition led by the Social Democratic Party in order to contest the 2024 legislative election. He made a speech praising Lu\u00eds Montenegro, who reportedly felt moved while listening it. Since Santana formally remains an independent, his presence in the event again fuels speculation about his possible return to his former party.\n\nOutside politics\n\nAfter resigning as Secretary of State for Culture, Santana Lopes successfully ran for president of Sporting CP. Despite being in office for less than a year, the club won the 1994\u20131995 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in football under his leadership.\n\nElectoral history\nEuropean Parliament election, 1987\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Party\n!

        "text": "Munib Rashid al-Masri (), also known as the \"Duke of Nablus\", and \"the Godfather\"(b. 1934), is a Palestinian industrialist, and patriarch of the al-Masri family.\n\nRelatives include a cousin, Arab Bank and Paltel chairman Sabih al-Masri, and nephews, developer Bashar Masri, and Jordanian former prime minister Taher al-Masri.\n\nOne of Yasser Arafat's closest friends and supporters, al-Masri has served as a minister in the cabinet of Jordan, and has on multiple occasions declined both the presidency and the prime ministership of Palestine.\n\nPersonal life\nAl-Masri was born in Nablus in 1934. He attended the an-Najah National University and graduated from the University of Texas in the United States. He was involved in establishing the al-Quds University. Al-Masri was shot and wounded by British soldiers in 1944.\n\nAl-Masri made his fortune in the oil industry, then returned to the West Bank in the 1990s and founded a stock exchange in Nablus.\n\nPolitical life\nAl-Masri was a close friend and confidant of Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat. He repeatedly turned down offers to become Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn the 2000s, al-Masri founded the Muntada Forum, a Palestinian lobbying group aimed at promoting reform and dialogue among the warring Palestinian factions.\n\nPeace efforts\nAl-Masri has stated that he has been working for the last 40 years to bring about a long lasting peace between Palestinians and Israelis. He would like to see an independent Palestine living in peace and harmony with Israel.\n\nIn May 2013, al-Masri and high-level Israeli high-tech entrepreneur Yossi Vardi unveiled the Breaking the Impasse (BTI) Initiative at the World Economic Forum held at the Dead Sea. At the launch, al-Masri stated, \"It\u2019s not for us to iron out the details. We are worried by the status quo. We want to change the status quo\u2026 Now the Israeli and Palestinian side [of the initiative] are very honest in their appeal: They want to break the impasse\u2026 They want the two sides to negotiate\u2026 to push all the parties to engage in real negotiations.\"\n\nThe BTI Forum was hosted by King Abdullah of Jordan and attended by John Kerry, Shimon Peres and Mahmoud Abbas. Breaking the Impasse initiatives goal is to encourage and support political leaders to work towards a two-state solution. al-Masri has stated that he will keep working towards achieving peace through the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which, like the Fez Initiative, offers Israel full recognition and normal relations with the Arabs in the context of comprehensive peace.\n\nPersonal\nHe is married to Angela Masri and they have four sons, Rabih, Mazen, Omar and Leith, and two daughters Mai Masri and Dina. Al-Masri is the cousin of Sabih al-Masri, one of Jordan's most prominent businessmen and the founder of the Palestine Securities Exchange.\n\nWealth\nAn Israeli newspaper once called al-Masri the \"Palestinian Rothschild\". \n\nBetween 1998 and 2000 he built a 70-acre estate with a palace that overlooks the city of Nablus, which he named Beit Falasteen or \"House of Palestine\", inspired by Andrea Palladio's 17th century Villa La Rotonda. Scholar Ghada Karmi described this as a \"zealous\" investment, \"meant to defy the Jewish settlements encroaching on this city.\" She noted that the palace was \"built commandingly\" on a hilltop, mirroring the Israeli settlements that were attempting to gain control of the land by occupying strategic locations.

His Animal Theology has been translated into Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and French.\n\nHe is most often quoted as saying\n\nHe also said \"Christians haven't got much further than thinking that the whole world was made for us, with the result that animals are only seen in an instrumental way as objects, machines, tools, and commodities, rather than fellow creatures\", and it is claimed that he \"wants to see animal abusers placed on a register and forbidden from keeping an animal, or working with them.\"\n\nHonours\nIn 1990, he was awarded the Peaceable Kingdom Medal for outstanding work in the field of theology and animals.

The day after the game, he said that winning a championship with Partizan was his greatest career accomplishment.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, Pavlovi\u0107 returned to Partizan and signed a contract for the rest of the season. In the ABA League debut in the new season, he led his team in an 89\u201380 victory over Mega Leks by scoring 26 points and having 4 rebounds and assists. Over 19 Adriatic League games, he averaged 11.9 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.\n\nPanathinaikos (2015\u20132016)\nOn July 9, 2015, Pavlovi\u0107 signed a one-year contract with the Greek club Panathinaikos. On April 21, 2016, he was released by the club.\n\nInternational career\nPavlovi\u0107 was a member of the Serbia and Montenegro Under-20 national team and played at the 2002 European Under-20 Championships in Lithuania. He was a member of the Serbia and Montenegro national team at the 2004 Olympic Games, playing in four games, averaging 3.5 points and 1.8 rebounds. Two years later, Montenegro, his native country, declared independence from the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. After that, Pavlovi\u0107 said that he would like to play for the Serbian national team.Pavlovi\u0107: \"Igrao bih za Srbiju\" However, he did not play for the Serbian or the Montenegrin national team. When asked about a possible comeback in February 2014, he responded with: \"I'm not thinking about the national team. To me, it became a political matter, not a sports matter.

        "text": "Neill Byrne (born 2 February 1993) is an Irish footballer who plays as a defender for  club Bradford City.\n\nCareer\n\n Early career \nByrne was born in Portmarnock, Ireland. He started his career with Irish sides Portmarnock and Belvedere before joining the Nottingham Forest Youth Academy at the age of 14. Despite interest from other clubs, two years later he signed apprentice terms with the club until 2011. Byrne was released by Forest in December 2011 and joined Rochdale on trial, scoring in a reserve game against Manchester City. After impressing on trial, Byrne signed an 18-month contract with the League One club on 1 January 2012. He made his debut for the Dale on 31 March 2012, in a 3\u20133 draw with relegation rivals Walsall. In November 2012, he joined Football Conference side Barrow on a one-month loan deal.\n\n AFC Telford United \nHe joined AFC Telford United in June 2013 after being released by Rochdale. On 26 April 2014, he won promotion to the Conference Premier with Telford after they clinched the Conference North title on the final game of the season.\n\n Macclesfield Town \nAfter his impressive season with Telford, he signed for Macclesfield Town. During his 2 year spell, he made 59 National League appearances and 3 FA Cup appearances. He scored 4 goals in the National League and started the majority of games, helping Macclesfield to 10th in the 2015\u201316 season. In the 2016\u201317 season, Macclesfield finished 9th in the National League. They also reached the final of the FA Trophy in 2016\u201317, however they lost 3\u20132 against York City.\n\nGateshead\nByrne agreed to join Gateshead on 26 May 2017 until the end of the season. He made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20132 defeat against Woking, scoring his first, and only, goal for the club three days later in a 1\u20130 victory over Guiseley.\n\n AFC Fylde \nIn May 2018, Byrne signed for AFC Fylde on a two-year deal. In his first year, he played 44 games in the National League and scored 2 goals as Fylde finished fifth in the table. In the play-offs, Fylde reached the final, but lost 3\u20130 to Salford City. Byrne also managed to help Fylde reach the final of the FA Trophy, while he did start the final, he was substituted off due to a head injury. Fylde won 1\u20130 against Leyton Orient.\n\nIn Byrne's second season for Fylde, he played 37 games in the National League and scored 2 goals. Unfortunately, his contributions were not enough, as Fylde were relegated after finishing in 23rd. Fylde managed to reach the third round of the FA Cup, before losing 2\u20131 to, then, Premier League side, Sheffield United.\n\nFC Halifax Town\nOn 23 September 2020, Byrne signed for National League side FC Halifax Town. In Byrne's first, and only, year at Halifax, he played 40 games and scored 1 goal in the National League. Halifax finished the season in tenth position.\n\nHartlepool United\nOn 16 July 2021, Byrne signed for Hartlepool United for an undisclosed fee.

The move would see Byrne play under manager Dave Challinor for a third time having also worked with him at AFC Fylde and Hartlepool United. He was a member of the Stockport side that won the League Two title in 2023\u201324, making 22 appearances throughout the season.\n\nBradford City\nOn 20 May 2024, Byrne signed for League Two club Bradford City on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee.\n\nCareer statistics\n \n\n+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competitionClubSeasonLeagueFA CupLeague CupOtherTotalDivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsRochdale2011\u201312League One30\u20140000302012\u201313League Two0010000010Total3010000040Barrow (loan)2012\u201313Conference Premier10\u2014\u20140010Southport (loan)2012\u201313Conference Premier102\u2014\u201400102AFC Telford United2013\u201314Conference North40200\u20142Appearances in FA Trophy04222014\u201315Conference Premier38410\u201420434Total786100040856Macclesfield Town2015\u201316National League27210\u2014413232016\u201317National League32220\u201490442Total6043000131765Gateshead2017\u201318National League39120\u201400411AFC Fylde2018\u201319National League442\u2014\u2014304722019\u201320National League37230\u201441443Total814300071915Halifax Town2020\u201321National League401\u2014\u201420421Hartlepool United2021\u201322League Two401501050511Tranmere Rovers2022\u201323League Two130112031192Stockport County2022\u201323League Two1900000202102023\u201324League Two161310030222Total351310050432Bradford City2024\u201325League Two92001010112Career total409222124040346327\n\nHonours\nMacclesfield Town\nFA Trophy runner-up: 2016\u201317\n\nAFC Fylde\nFA Trophy: 2018\u201319\n\nStockport County\nEFL League Two: 2023\u201324\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1993 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People from Portmarnock\nCategory:Sportspeople from Fingal\nCategory:Republic of Ireland men's association footballers\nCategory:Republic of Ireland men's youth international footballers\nCategory:Men's association football defenders\nCategory:Nottingham Forest F.C. players\nCategory:Rochdale A.F.C. players\nCategory:Barrow A.F.C. players\nCategory:AFC Telford United players\nCategory:Macclesfield Town F.C. players\nCategory:Gateshead F.C. players\nCategory:AFC Fylde players\nCategory:FC Halifax Town players\nCategory:Hartlepool United F.C. players\nCategory:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players\nCategory:Stockport County F.C. players\nCategory:Bradford City A.F.C. players\nCategory:English Football League players\nCategory:National League (English football) players\nCategory:Belvedere F.C. players\nCategory:Association footballers from County Dublin\nCategory:21st-century Irish sportsmen",

        "text": "Michael George Holmgren (born June 15, 1948) is an American former football coach and executive in the National Football League (NFL). He began his NFL career as a quarterbacks' coach and later as an offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers, where they won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV. He served as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 1998, where he won Super Bowl XXXI, and of the Seattle Seahawks from 1999 to 2008. His last role in the NFL was as team president of the Cleveland Browns from 2010 to 2012. Prior to his career in the NFL, Holmgren coached football at the high school and collegiate levels.\n\nHolmgren is noted for his role in molding quarterbacks such as Steve Young, Brett Favre, and Matt Hasselbeck during his tenures in San Francisco, Green Bay, and Seattle, respectively. Joe Montana won his two MVP awards under the direction of Holmgren in 1989 and 1990.\n\nUnder Holmgren's leadership and play-calling, the Green Bay Packers were consistent winners and never had a losing season. He was considered one of the best coaches in the NFL by many fellow coaches and players. He led the Packers to their 12th league championship in Super Bowl XXXI, a 35\u201321 win over the New England Patriots; and also reached Super Bowl XXXII. Under Holmgren the Seahawks also became a frequent playoff team, including five division titles and the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XL. In total, Holmgren won eight division titles as a head coach to go along with twelve playoff appearances, three NFC Championships and one Super Bowl.\n\nAs president of the Cleveland Browns, Holmgren failed to improve the team, which had a record of 5\u201311 the season before his arrival, and 14\u201334 in his tenure. Despite Holmgren's reputation as a quarterback guru, the Browns fielded three different opening-day starters in his three years with the team. In the face of much criticism in the media and new ownership, he was released by the Browns in November 2012.\n\nHe is a weekday daily guest throughout the football season on Seattle radio station Sports Radio KJR across various shows. As of 2021, Holmgren also works as a guest analyst for Super Bowl broadcasts on Westwood One.\n\nCareer\n\nPlaying career\nHolmgren started out as a tight end before becoming a standout quarterback and punter at San Francisco's Abraham Lincoln High School where he was named \"Prep Athlete of the Year\" in 1965 and graduated in 1966.\n\nHolmgren continued his playing career in Los Angeles as a quarterback at the University of Southern California from 1966 to 1969, and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. As a sophomore, he was on USC's national championship team of 1967. Holmgren played behind starter Steve Sogge in 1967 and 1968. A shoulder injury put him behind sophomore Jimmy Jones in 1969; he earned his bachelor's degree in 1970.\n\nAlthough a backup, Holmgren was selected in the 1970 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals; taken in the eighth round (201st overall), he went to camp with both the Cardinals and the New York Jets that year.\n\nCoaching career\n\nHigh school\nHolmgren's coaching career began in 1971 at his alma mater, Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, where he also taught history. One year later, he moved to San Francisco's Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory as a teacher and assistant coach. He also coached at Oak Grove High School in San Jose, California, from 1975 to 1980 and won one Central Coast Section championship.CCS Football Champions Year-By-Year \n\nCollege\n\nIn 1981, Holmgren became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the San Francisco State Gators, working for Vic Rowen.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985, Holmgren was the quarterbacks coach at Brigham Young University under LaVell Edwards. During his four-year tenure at BYU, Holmgren not only helped coach the team's potent offense to a national championship in 1984, but in that period mentored and developed two of BYU's future NFL quarterbacks, Steve Young and Robbie Bosco, and one future NFL head coach, Andy Reid.\n\nBosco would make it to Green Bay several years before Holmgren, but his eventual appointment as Packers head coach would bring him back into contact with Andy Reid and Steve Young.\n\nUnder Holmgren, Bosco led the Cougars to a national championship in 1984, finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 1985. Bosco's NFL career was cut short by an arm injury, and he returned to BYU as a quarterbacks coach.\n\nIn addition to mentoring quarterbacks at BYU, Holmgren also worked with Reid, at the time a graduate assistant. Reid went on to become an offensive line coach at Holmgren's previous school, San Francisco State, and in 1992 rejoined Holmgren in Green Bay as offensive assistant coach. In 1998 Reid became quarterbacks coach and assistant coach, then in 1999 was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nProfessional\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nHolmgren began his NFL coaching career as an assistant coach of the San Francisco 49ers from 1986 to 1991. He coached the 49ers' quarterbacks from 1986 to 1988 under head coach Bill Walsh, working with Steve Young, whom he had coached at BYU, and Joe Montana. When George Seifert took over as head coach, Holmgren became the team's offensive coordinator and served from 1989 to 1991. In this stretch, Joe Montana won his two MVP awards and had his best season in 1989. During his tenure with San Francisco, the 49ers posted a 71-\u201323\u20131 (74.7%) regular season record to reach the postseason each year except 1991. San Francisco won Super Bowl XXIII over the Cincinnati Bengals 20\u201316 and Super Bowl XXIV over the Denver Broncos 55\u201310, setting records for most points, most offensive points, and margin of victory in a Super Bowl. As offensive coordinator in 1989, Holmgren's 49er offense was ranked number one in the NFL. His years with the 49ers have led to later success mentoring other young assistants and Holmgren is one of the larger branches of the Sid Gillman coaching tree, from which Walsh and Seifert descended.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nthumb|left|Holmgren in 1997\nthumb|right|Holmgren in a 1998 game\nHolmgren was head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 1998, which became one of the most successful coaching stints in NFL history. As head coach of the Packers, Holmgren posted a 75\u201337\u20130 (67.0%) regular-season record, a 9\u20135 (64.3%) postseason mark, and two Super Bowl appearances, including a 35\u201321 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. By winning at least one game in five consecutive postseasons (1993\u20131997) Holmgren joined John Madden (1973\u20131977), John Harbaugh (2008\u20132012), Bill Belichick (2011\u20132018), and Pete Carroll (2012\u20132016) as the only coaches in league history to accomplish the feat. Holmgren's Packers posted an NFL-best 48\u201316 (75.0%) record, finished first in the NFC Central Division three times and second once, and set a 7\u20133 mark in the playoffs between 1995 and 1998. By taking the Packers to six consecutive postseasons (1993\u20131998), Holmgren set a franchise record with a team that had had just two winning seasons in the 19 years before he was hired. Holmgren is well known for molding quarterback Brett Favre from a wild gun slinger to a three time MVP from 1995 to 1997.\n\nMany of Holmgren's 1992 coaches, including Andy Reid, Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron, Ray Rhodes, and Jon Gruden, would go on to head coaching careers in the NFL. Marty Mornhinweg, an assistant hired later in Holmgren's tenure at Green Bay, also became an NFL head coach, and was previously an offensive coordinator under Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles from 2006 to 2012. Doug Pederson, a backup quarterback for Holmgren's Packers from 1996 through 1998, would also serve as an assistant under Reid in both Philadelphia and with the Kansas City Chiefs, later winning Super Bowl LII as the head coach of the Eagles in 2018.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\nHolmgren resigned from the Green Bay Packers after the 1998 season to accept an eight-year, $32\u00a0million head coach contract offered by the Seattle Seahawks. Originally, Holmgren was the executive vice president and general manager and head coach of the Seahawks. Following the 2002 season, Holmgren was terminated as general manager.\n\nHolmgren took the Seahawks to their first postseason since 1988 during his first season with the club in 1999, breaking a 10-year playoff drought. Holmgren posted a 72\u201356 (56.3%) regular season record and a 4\u20136 postseason record, including an AFC West Division title (1999), one NFC Wildcard berth (2003), four consecutive NFC West Division titles (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007), an NFC championship (2005), and the Seahawks' first-ever appearance in a Super Bowl.\n\nHolmgren's (and the Seahawks' until they won the Super Bowl in 2013) best season to date was 2005. The team posted the best regular season 13\u20133 (81.3%) record in franchise history, set a team record 11 consecutive wins, and won their first playoff game since 1984. Holmgren also molded former Green Bay backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck into a Pro Bowl and Super Bowl quarterback in the 2005 NFL season (much as he did with Favre in the 1990s), and coached Shaun Alexander to the NFL's MVP, a 2005 rushing title, and an NFL record 28 touchdowns in a single season.\n\nWith the 2005 NFC Championship win, Holmgren became the fifth member of a small coaching fraternity that has taken two different NFL franchises to the Super Bowl, joining Bill Parcells, Dan Reeves, Don Shula, Dick Vermeil, and later John Fox and Andy Reid. Had the Seahawks won Super Bowl XL, he would have become the first head coach in NFL history to win a Super Bowl with two different franchises, however they fell short, losing 21\u201310 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOn January 22, 2008, Holmgren announced he would serve out the remaining year of his contract with a lame duck year and end his tenure as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks at the end of the 2008 NFL season. Jim L. Mora, the defensive backs coach, succeeded Holmgren upon his departure.\n\nOn December 19, 2008, Holmgren received the Steve Largent Award, becoming the first coach in Seahawks history to attain the accolade.Williams, Eric. (December 19, 2008). Friday practice -- Holmgren receives Largent award. thenewstribune.com. Retrieved December 21, 2008 from \n\nPost-coaching career\nOn February 1, 2009, Holmgren served as an analyst for NBC's coverage of Super Bowl XLIII.\nSince 2012, He has served as an analyst for Seattle Sports station KJR 950AM and as a color analyst for Westwood One's radio broadcast of Super Bowl LI.\n\nOn December 21, 2009, Holmgren accepted the job to be president of the Cleveland Browns. On January 3, 2011, Holmgren fired Browns coach Eric Mangini after a disappointing 5\u201311 record. On October 16, 2012, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam announced that Holmgren would leave the team at the end of the 2012 season.\n\nIn 2015, Holmgren was in consideration for the New York Jets head coaching job, but removed himself from speculation after entertaining the idea. The Jets would end up hiring Todd Bowles.\n\nIn 2020, he was named as a coaching finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's \"Centennial Slate\". He was again up for the class of 2021, but was among the coaches part of the final cut.\n\nHe was inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor on October 31, 2021.\n\nIn 2024, he was named as a coach finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nHead coaching record\nTeam Year Regular season PostseasonWonLostTiesWin %Finish Won  Lost  Win %  ResultGB1992970.5632nd in NFC Central \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013GB1993970.5633rd in NFC Central11.500Lost to Dallas Cowboys in NFC Divisional GameGB1994970.5632nd in NFC Central11.500Lost to Dallas Cowboys in NFC Divisional GameGB19951150.6881st in NFC Central21.667Lost to Dallas Cowboys in NFC Championship GameGB19961330.8131st in NFC Central301.000Super Bowl XXXI championsGB19971330.8131st in NFC Central 21.667Lost to Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIIGB19981150.6882nd in NFC Central01.000Lost to San Francisco 49ers in NFC Wild Card GameGB Total75370.67095.643SEA1999970.5631st in AFC West01.000Lost to Miami Dolphins in AFC Wild Card GameSEA20006100.3754th in AFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA2001970.5632nd in AFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA2002790.4383rd in NFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA20031060.6252nd in NFC West010.000Lost to Green Bay Packers in NFC Wild Card GameSEA2004970.5631st in NFC West010.000Lost to St. Louis Rams in NFC Wild Card GameSEA20051330.8131st in NFC West210.667Lost to Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLSEA2006970.5631st in NFC West110.500Lost to Chicago Bears in NFC Divisional GameSEA20071060.6251st in NFC West110.500 Lost to Green Bay Packers in NFC Divisional GameSEA20084120.2503rd in NFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA Total86740.54146.400Total1611110.5921311.542\n\nCoaching tree\nHolmgren has worked under two head coaches: \nBill Walsh, San Francisco 49ers (1986\u20131988)\nGeorge Seifert, San Francisco 49ers (1989\u20131991)\n\nEleven of Holmgren's assistant coaches/executives became head coaches in the NFL or NCAA:\nRay Rhodes, Philadelphia Eagles (1995\u20131998), Green Bay Packers (1999)\nSteve Mariucci, San Francisco 49ers (1997\u20132002), Detroit Lions (2003\u20132005)\nJon Gruden, Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders (1998\u20132001, 2018\u20132021), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2002\u20132008)\nDick Jauron, Chicago Bears (1999\u20132003), Buffalo Bills (2006\u20132009)\nAndy Reid, Philadelphia Eagles (1999\u20132012), Kansas City Chiefs (2013\u2013present)\nMike Sherman, Green Bay Packers (2000\u20132005), Texas A&M (2008\u20132011)\nMarty Mornhinweg, Detroit Lions (2001\u20132002)\nJim Zorn, Washington Redskins (2008\u20132009)\nJim L.

        "text": "Michael George Holmgren (born June 15, 1948) is an American former football coach and executive in the National Football League (NFL). He began his NFL career as a quarterbacks' coach and later as an offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers, where they won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV. He served as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 1998, where he won Super Bowl XXXI, and of the Seattle Seahawks from 1999 to 2008. His last role in the NFL was as team president of the Cleveland Browns from 2010 to 2012. Prior to his career in the NFL, Holmgren coached football at the high school and collegiate levels.\n\nHolmgren is noted for his role in molding quarterbacks such as Steve Young, Brett Favre, and Matt Hasselbeck during his tenures in San Francisco, Green Bay, and Seattle, respectively. Joe Montana won his two MVP awards under the direction of Holmgren in 1989 and 1990.\n\nUnder Holmgren's leadership and play-calling, the Green Bay Packers were consistent winners and never had a losing season. He was considered one of the best coaches in the NFL by many fellow coaches and players. He led the Packers to their 12th league championship in Super Bowl XXXI, a 35\u201321 win over the New England Patriots; and also reached Super Bowl XXXII. Under Holmgren the Seahawks also became a frequent playoff team, including five division titles and the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XL. In total, Holmgren won eight division titles as a head coach to go along with twelve playoff appearances, three NFC Championships and one Super Bowl.\n\nAs president of the Cleveland Browns, Holmgren failed to improve the team, which had a record of 5\u201311 the season before his arrival, and 14\u201334 in his tenure. Despite Holmgren's reputation as a quarterback guru, the Browns fielded three different opening-day starters in his three years with the team. In the face of much criticism in the media and new ownership, he was released by the Browns in November 2012.\n\nHe is a weekday daily guest throughout the football season on Seattle radio station Sports Radio KJR across various shows. As of 2021, Holmgren also works as a guest analyst for Super Bowl broadcasts on Westwood One.\n\nCareer\n\nPlaying career\nHolmgren started out as a tight end before becoming a standout quarterback and punter at San Francisco's Abraham Lincoln High School where he was named \"Prep Athlete of the Year\" in 1965 and graduated in 1966.\n\nHolmgren continued his playing career in Los Angeles as a quarterback at the University of Southern California from 1966 to 1969, and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. As a sophomore, he was on USC's national championship team of 1967. Holmgren played behind starter Steve Sogge in 1967 and 1968. A shoulder injury put him behind sophomore Jimmy Jones in 1969; he earned his bachelor's degree in 1970.\n\nAlthough a backup, Holmgren was selected in the 1970 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals; taken in the eighth round (201st overall), he went to camp with both the Cardinals and the New York Jets that year.\n\nCoaching career\n\nHigh school\nHolmgren's coaching career began in 1971 at his alma mater, Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, where he also taught history. One year later, he moved to San Francisco's Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory as a teacher and assistant coach. He also coached at Oak Grove High School in San Jose, California, from 1975 to 1980 and won one Central Coast Section championship.CCS Football Champions Year-By-Year \n\nCollege\n\nIn 1981, Holmgren became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the San Francisco State Gators, working for Vic Rowen.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985, Holmgren was the quarterbacks coach at Brigham Young University under LaVell Edwards. During his four-year tenure at BYU, Holmgren not only helped coach the team's potent offense to a national championship in 1984, but in that period mentored and developed two of BYU's future NFL quarterbacks, Steve Young and Robbie Bosco, and one future NFL head coach, Andy Reid.\n\nBosco would make it to Green Bay several years before Holmgren, but his eventual appointment as Packers head coach would bring him back into contact with Andy Reid and Steve Young.\n\nUnder Holmgren, Bosco led the Cougars to a national championship in 1984, finished third in Heisman Trophy balloting and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 1985. Bosco's NFL career was cut short by an arm injury, and he returned to BYU as a quarterbacks coach.\n\nIn addition to mentoring quarterbacks at BYU, Holmgren also worked with Reid, at the time a graduate assistant. Reid went on to become an offensive line coach at Holmgren's previous school, San Francisco State, and in 1992 rejoined Holmgren in Green Bay as offensive assistant coach. In 1998 Reid became quarterbacks coach and assistant coach, then in 1999 was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nProfessional\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nHolmgren began his NFL coaching career as an assistant coach of the San Francisco 49ers from 1986 to 1991. He coached the 49ers' quarterbacks from 1986 to 1988 under head coach Bill Walsh, working with Steve Young, whom he had coached at BYU, and Joe Montana. When George Seifert took over as head coach, Holmgren became the team's offensive coordinator and served from 1989 to 1991. In this stretch, Joe Montana won his two MVP awards and had his best season in 1989. During his tenure with San Francisco, the 49ers posted a 71-\u201323\u20131 (74.7%) regular season record to reach the postseason each year except 1991. San Francisco won Super Bowl XXIII over the Cincinnati Bengals 20\u201316 and Super Bowl XXIV over the Denver Broncos 55\u201310, setting records for most points, most offensive points, and margin of victory in a Super Bowl. As offensive coordinator in 1989, Holmgren's 49er offense was ranked number one in the NFL. His years with the 49ers have led to later success mentoring other young assistants and Holmgren is one of the larger branches of the Sid Gillman coaching tree, from which Walsh and Seifert descended.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nthumb|left|Holmgren in 1997\nthumb|right|Holmgren in a 1998 game\nHolmgren was head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 1998, which became one of the most successful coaching stints in NFL history. As head coach of the Packers, Holmgren posted a 75\u201337\u20130 (67.0%) regular-season record, a 9\u20135 (64.3%) postseason mark, and two Super Bowl appearances, including a 35\u201321 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. By winning at least one game in five consecutive postseasons (1993\u20131997) Holmgren joined John Madden (1973\u20131977), John Harbaugh (2008\u20132012), Bill Belichick (2011\u20132018), and Pete Carroll (2012\u20132016) as the only coaches in league history to accomplish the feat. Holmgren's Packers posted an NFL-best 48\u201316 (75.0%) record, finished first in the NFC Central Division three times and second once, and set a 7\u20133 mark in the playoffs between 1995 and 1998. By taking the Packers to six consecutive postseasons (1993\u20131998), Holmgren set a franchise record with a team that had had just two winning seasons in the 19 years before he was hired. Holmgren is well known for molding quarterback Brett Favre from a wild gun slinger to a three time MVP from 1995 to 1997.\n\nMany of Holmgren's 1992 coaches, including Andy Reid, Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron, Ray Rhodes, and Jon Gruden, would go on to head coaching careers in the NFL. Marty Mornhinweg, an assistant hired later in Holmgren's tenure at Green Bay, also became an NFL head coach, and was previously an offensive coordinator under Reid with the Philadelphia Eagles from 2006 to 2012. Doug Pederson, a backup quarterback for Holmgren's Packers from 1996 through 1998, would also serve as an assistant under Reid in both Philadelphia and with the Kansas City Chiefs, later winning Super Bowl LII as the head coach of the Eagles in 2018.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\nHolmgren resigned from the Green Bay Packers after the 1998 season to accept an eight-year, $32\u00a0million head coach contract offered by the Seattle Seahawks. Originally, Holmgren was the executive vice president and general manager and head coach of the Seahawks. Following the 2002 season, Holmgren was terminated as general manager.\n\nHolmgren took the Seahawks to their first postseason since 1988 during his first season with the club in 1999, breaking a 10-year playoff drought. Holmgren posted a 72\u201356 (56.3%) regular season record and a 4\u20136 postseason record, including an AFC West Division title (1999), one NFC Wildcard berth (2003), four consecutive NFC West Division titles (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007), an NFC championship (2005), and the Seahawks' first-ever appearance in a Super Bowl.\n\nHolmgren's (and the Seahawks' until they won the Super Bowl in 2013) best season to date was 2005. The team posted the best regular season 13\u20133 (81.3%) record in franchise history, set a team record 11 consecutive wins, and won their first playoff game since 1984. Holmgren also molded former Green Bay backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck into a Pro Bowl and Super Bowl quarterback in the 2005 NFL season (much as he did with Favre in the 1990s), and coached Shaun Alexander to the NFL's MVP, a 2005 rushing title, and an NFL record 28 touchdowns in a single season.\n\nWith the 2005 NFC Championship win, Holmgren became the fifth member of a small coaching fraternity that has taken two different NFL franchises to the Super Bowl, joining Bill Parcells, Dan Reeves, Don Shula, Dick Vermeil, and later John Fox and Andy Reid. Had the Seahawks won Super Bowl XL, he would have become the first head coach in NFL history to win a Super Bowl with two different franchises, however they fell short, losing 21\u201310 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOn January 22, 2008, Holmgren announced he would serve out the remaining year of his contract with a lame duck year and end his tenure as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks at the end of the 2008 NFL season. Jim L. Mora, the defensive backs coach, succeeded Holmgren upon his departure.\n\nOn December 19, 2008, Holmgren received the Steve Largent Award, becoming the first coach in Seahawks history to attain the accolade.Williams, Eric. (December 19, 2008). Friday practice -- Holmgren receives Largent award. thenewstribune.com. Retrieved December 21, 2008 from \n\nPost-coaching career\nOn February 1, 2009, Holmgren served as an analyst for NBC's coverage of Super Bowl XLIII.\nSince 2012, He has served as an analyst for Seattle Sports station KJR 950AM and as a color analyst for Westwood One's radio broadcast of Super Bowl LI.\n\nOn December 21, 2009, Holmgren accepted the job to be president of the Cleveland Browns. On January 3, 2011, Holmgren fired Browns coach Eric Mangini after a disappointing 5\u201311 record. On October 16, 2012, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam announced that Holmgren would leave the team at the end of the 2012 season.\n\nIn 2015, Holmgren was in consideration for the New York Jets head coaching job, but removed himself from speculation after entertaining the idea. The Jets would end up hiring Todd Bowles.\n\nIn 2020, he was named as a coaching finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's \"Centennial Slate\". He was again up for the class of 2021, but was among the coaches part of the final cut.\n\nHe was inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor on October 31, 2021.\n\nIn 2024, he was named as a coach finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nHead coaching record\nTeam Year Regular season PostseasonWonLostTiesWin %Finish Won  Lost  Win %  ResultGB1992970.5632nd in NFC Central \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013GB1993970.5633rd in NFC Central11.500Lost to Dallas Cowboys in NFC Divisional GameGB1994970.5632nd in NFC Central11.500Lost to Dallas Cowboys in NFC Divisional GameGB19951150.6881st in NFC Central21.667Lost to Dallas Cowboys in NFC Championship GameGB19961330.8131st in NFC Central301.000Super Bowl XXXI championsGB19971330.8131st in NFC Central 21.667Lost to Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIIGB19981150.6882nd in NFC Central01.000Lost to San Francisco 49ers in NFC Wild Card GameGB Total75370.67095.643SEA1999970.5631st in AFC West01.000Lost to Miami Dolphins in AFC Wild Card GameSEA20006100.3754th in AFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA2001970.5632nd in AFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA2002790.4383rd in NFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA20031060.6252nd in NFC West010.000Lost to Green Bay Packers in NFC Wild Card GameSEA2004970.5631st in NFC West010.000Lost to St. Louis Rams in NFC Wild Card GameSEA20051330.8131st in NFC West210.667Lost to Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLSEA2006970.5631st in NFC West110.500Lost to Chicago Bears in NFC Divisional GameSEA20071060.6251st in NFC West110.500 Lost to Green Bay Packers in NFC Divisional GameSEA20084120.2503rd in NFC West \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013SEA Total86740.54146.400Total1611110.5921311.542\n\nCoaching tree\nHolmgren has worked under two head coaches: \nBill Walsh, San Francisco 49ers (1986\u20131988)\nGeorge Seifert, San Francisco 49ers (1989\u20131991)\n\nEleven of Holmgren's assistant coaches/executives became head coaches in the NFL or NCAA:\nRay Rhodes, Philadelphia Eagles (1995\u20131998), Green Bay Packers (1999)\nSteve Mariucci, San Francisco 49ers (1997\u20132002), Detroit Lions (2003\u20132005)\nJon Gruden, Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders (1998\u20132001, 2018\u20132021), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2002\u20132008)\nDick Jauron, Chicago Bears (1999\u20132003), Buffalo Bills (2006\u20132009)\nAndy Reid, Philadelphia Eagles (1999\u20132012), Kansas City Chiefs (2013\u2013present)\nMike Sherman, Green Bay Packers (2000\u20132005), Texas A&M (2008\u20132011)\nMarty Mornhinweg, Detroit Lions (2001\u20132002)\nJim Zorn, Washington Redskins (2008\u20132009)\nJim L.

        "text": "thumb|Gregory L. Schulte\nGregory L. Schulte (born 1958) was the U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency from July 2005 through June 2009. Schulte served as the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations Office at Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international organizations in Vienna.  Assuming his post on July 13, 2005, Schulte was charged with advancing the President's agenda in countering proliferation, terrorism, organized crime, and corruption, while promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\nAppointed by President George W. Bush in January 2003, Schulte served as Executive Secretary of the National Security Council (NSC) through March 2005. He was accountable to Condoleezza Rice for overseeing the NSC staff, the national security decision-making process, and the White House Situation Room.\n\nSchulte served as Senior Director for Southeast European Affairs on the NSC staff from 2000 to 2002, overseeing U.S. diplomacy and military deployments in Bosnia and Kosovo and collaboration with the United Nations and European Union. He helped guide and coordinate interagency efforts to bring democracy to Serbia and prevent civil war in Macedonia.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2000, Schulte served as Principal Director for Requirements, Plans and Counterproliferation Policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense at The Pentagon. His duties included review of U.S. war plans and policy oversight of efforts to protect U.S. and allied forces in the face of nuclear, biological, and chemical threats.\n\nAs Special Assistant to the President for Implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords on the NSC staff from 1998 to 1999, Schulte coordinated U.S. diplomacy and support for the NATO air campaign that stopped ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. He co-chaired the NSC Executive Committee that planned for the subsequent UN and NATO missions in Kosovo.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1998, Schulte was assigned to the NATO International Staff in Belgium. As Director of the Bosnia Task Force, he helped prepare NATO's first \"out of area\" operations and manage its relations with the United Nations, Russia, and other Partner countries. He worked with NATO political and military authorities to develop guidance for air strikes in Bosnia, deployment of IFOR, and transition to SFOR. He simultaneously served as Director for Nuclear Planning, assisting in the restructuring of NATO's nuclear weapons posture after the Cold War.\n\nSchulte worked for the Secretary of Defense from 1985 to 1992 as Director for Strategic Forces Policy and Assistant for Theater Nuclear Forces Policy. He contributed to two nuclear weapons treaties, two Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, a Strategic Targeting Review, a Failsafe and Risk Reduction Review, and NATO's Nuclear Planning Group.\n\nIn 2020, Schulte, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and \"To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1958 births\nCategory:International Atomic Energy Agency officials\nCategory:Representatives of the United States to the United Nations International Organizations in Vienna",

From 2015 to 2019 he served as the Minister of Health in the Second Tsipras Cabinet. He previously served as an Alternate Minister of Health in the First Tsipras Cabinet and is a member of the Central Committee of Syriza.\n\nEducation\n\nXanthos graduated from the medical school of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n\nMedical career\n\nXanthos specialises in microbiology and worked as a national health service doctor at the health centres in Perama and in Rethymno. He was, for several years, chairman of the doctors' union in Rethymno and also a member of the General Council of the Federation of Greek Hospital Doctors (OENGE) and the General Assembly of the Panhellenic Medical Association (PIS).\n\nXanthos took an active role in the establishment of a Voluntary Social Solidarity Clinic in Rethymno in 2008.\n\nPolitical career\n\nXanthos is a member of the Central Committee of Syriza. He was first elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Rethymno, Crete, in the May 2012 legislative election and was subsequently reelected in June 2012, January 2015 and September 2015.\n\nIn January 2015, Xanthos was appointed as an Alternate Minister of Health in the First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras. In April, he claimed between 2.5 and 3 million people are \"lost in the bureaucracy of a National Health System\" and announced plans to cover uninsured Greeks.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras, in September 2015, Xanthos was appointed as the Minister of Health. Pavlos Polakis was also appointed to the Ministry of Health as an Alternate Minister of Health. It was noted that both Xanthos and Polakis were Cretan ministers, two of only three in the government. In an interview with Kathimerini in October 2015, Xanthos addressed the frailty of the National Health System, noting that he was reversing the six year trend of reducing the number of staff in the Service by hiring 3,400 additional staff members by 2016.\n\nIn an interview with Mega, a television station, in November 2015, Xanthos acknowledged that \"[t]he healthcare system condition is on the verge of falling apart and the government knows this.\" He also agreed with the warnings of doctors that the healthcare system was constantly on the verge of a blackout due to the lack of staff. In November, Xanthos also met with Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General of the IFRC, on a two-day visit to Greece.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:Greek microbiologists\nCategory:Government ministers of Greece\nCategory:Syriza politicians\nCategory:Greek MPs 2012 (May)\nCategory:Greek MPs 2012\u20132014\nCategory:Greek MPs 2015 (February\u2013August)\nCategory:Greek MPs 2015\u20132019\nCategory:Aristotle University of Thessaloniki alumni\nCategory:20th-century Greek physicians\nCategory:21st-century Greek physicians\nCategory:People from Rethymno\nCategory:Greek MPs 2019\u20132023\nCategory:Health ministers of Greece",

        "text": "is the pseudonym of a Japanese artist from Osaka, Japan, who is one of the founding members of the visual novel brand Key under VisualArt's. Hinoue's choice of her pseudonym stems from the manga C by Sh\u014d Kitagawa; the protagonist in the manga was named . Before forming Key, Hinoue worked for the company Tactics where she had a hand in the creation of the company's three games: D\u014dsei, Moon, and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. After forming Key, Hinoue has become known for her work on such titles as Kanon, Air and Clannad. Her d\u014djinshi circle is known as \"Soldier Frog\". In September 2016, Hinoue resigned from Key and VisualArt's.\n\nCareer\nHinoue entered a vocational school to become a professional artist due to the influence of the popular adult visual novel D\u014dky\u016bsei by ELF. Her first work for a visual novel was as one of many artists for Tamago Ry\u014dri by Bon Bin Pompon in 1996, but shortly after transferred to the software company Tactics under the publisher Nexton. There, she was the art director of three games: D\u014dsei, Moon, and One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. After the completion of One, Hinoue and much of the staff who made both Moon and One, including Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito, Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS, left Tactics to work under the video game publishing company VisualArt's where they formed the company Key. At Key, Hinoue was the sole art director for their first three titles, Kanon, Air, and Clannad, but did not contribute for the two games that followed, Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet, and Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life.\n\nFor Key's games Little Busters!, Little Busters! Ecstasy and Kud Wafter, Hinoue shared the position of art director with fellow artist Na-Ga, though Na-Ga provided most of the art for the characters. Outside of Key in 2006, Hinoue was the art director for the yaoi visual novel Bokura wa Minna, Koi o suru by the company Pekoe, also under VisualArt's. In 2007, Hinoue provided uniform design and one of five character designs in a five-part moe adult drama CD series named School Heart's produced by Mana, a brand under VisualArt's. Between December 2007 and August 2010, Hinoue was one of three personalities (the others being Shinji Orito and another named woman from Pekoe named Chiro) on an Internet radio show sponsored by Key in regards to the brand called Key Net Radio. Hinoue worked on Key's ninth game Rewrite by heading the project's planning, and acting as the sole art director and character designer. Hinoue was also the sole art director and character designer for Key's games Rewrite Harvest festa! in 2012 and Harmonia in 2016, which was her last contribution with Key before resigning from VisualArt's in September 2016.\n\nArt style and reception\nthumb|150px|A self-portrait caricature of Itaru Hinoue\nItaru Hinoue has a distinct style of character art that evolved over the years, but there are still consistencies in her art style. Her characters have very small noses and mouths placed within close proximity of each other which leaves an abnormally large separation between the mouth and bottom of the chin. In contrast, she draws eyes relatively large and are widely spaced apart from each other. The limbs of her characters are depicted as long and narrow, along with possessing a long torso. These recurring characteristics of her art are referred to by her Japanese fans as . She is skilled in preserving the psychological description of her characters via their facial expressions. Her style of drawing erotic content is also seen as being distinct. As seen with her art from 2006 onwards, such as in Little Busters!, much of her distinct style that she has become known for has generally either been omitted or improved upon.\n\nShortly before the release of Clannad, two autographed illustrations by Hinoue were put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in April 2004; bidding for the drawings started at 1 yen (about US$0.01). One of the drawings was bid on by forty-eight people was sold for 479,000 yen (about US$4,300), while the second drawing was bid on by 113 people and fetched 531,000 yen (about US$4,800). The latter item is the fifth most expensive item sold on Yahoo! Auction since April 2001, while the former is the twelfth most expensive.\n\nHinoue was one of several prominent artists who illustrated a pin-up for the manga Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens. The pin-up, released in the third volume, was drawn in collaboration with the manga's author Eri Takenashi. Hinoue also provided a still image used in episode four of Kannagis anime adaptation as the ending illustration.\n\nAn art book titled White Clover: Itaru Hinoue Art Works featuring illustrations by Hinoue was released on February 28, 2009 as a limited edition by Key at Key 10th Memorial Fes. The book was the single-most expensive item sold at the event, and contains over 170 illustrations of mainly heroines featured in Key's visual novels, but also contains other works by Hinoue such as One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. Upon release, it was later discovered that there were some problems with some of the books, such as missing or out-of-order pages, or small dark specks on some of the illustrations. The art book was released for general sale on June 26, 2009 and features a different cover.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nItaru Hinoue's official website \n\nCategory:Japanese illustrators\nCategory:Japanese video game designers\nCategory:Key (company)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Japanese video game artists\nCategory:Year of birth missing (living people)\nCategory:Women video game designers",

Lehre became friends with Bass while hosting the American Music Awards red carpet pre-show together in 2010.\n\nThe music video for Heart2Heart's debut single \"Facebook Official\" was directed by Lehre.\n\nChad Future\nInspired by his interest in K-Pop and American pop music, Lehre officially announced his solo music project under the stage name Chad Future in 2012, with a goal to bridge the gap between the genres. He chose the stage name Chad Future because he was nicknamed Chad while doing character work in high school theater.\n\nChad Future began creating English covers of popular K-pop songs by artists such as EXO, BigBang, and B.A.P., which received attention from fans and some of the actual artists.\n\nChad Future's English remix of BigBang's \"Loser\", which also featured American recording artist Preston Knight, was chosen as the winner of YG Entertainment's Made Series M cover competition.\n\nChad Future performed at the first KCON in 2012, and made his official debut on M-Net's M Countdown in Los Angeles on August 25, 2013.\n\nHe released The First Mini Album in 2014, a 5-song EP which featured collaborations with K-Pop recording artists VIXX's Ravi and NU'EST's Aron.\n\nChad Future's first television special \"I Am Chad Future\" aired on Mnet America in 2014, which documented the creation of his first album and the preparation of his M Countdown performance.

        "text": "William A  Gardner (born Allen William Mclean, November 4, 1942) is a theoretically inclined electrical engineer who specializes in the advancement of the theory of statistical time-series analysis and statistical inference with emphasis on signal processing algorithm design and performance analysis. He is also an entrepreneur, a professor emeritus with the University of California, Davis, founder of the R&D firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), and former president, CEO, and chief scientist of this firm for 25 years (1986 to 2011) prior to sale of its IP to Lockheed Martin.\n\nGardner has authored four advanced-level engineering books on statistical signal processing theory including Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Nonprobabilistic Theory, 1987, which has been cited over 1200 times in peer-reviewed journal articles. Gardner's approach in this book is considered to be in keeping with the work of Norbert Wiener in his classic treatise Generalized Harmonic Analysis first published in 1930.\n\nIn the literature, Gardner is referred to as an influential pioneer of cyclostationarity theory and methodology, on the basis of his being a contributor of seminal advances. Gardner has written more than 100 peer-reviewed original-research articles. His research papers and books have been cited in seventeen thousand peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\n Biography \nGardner married Nancy Susan Lenhart in June 1966 and the following year completed his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology while employed as a member of technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1967 to 1969, and completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Massachusetts under the supervision of Lewis E. Franks in 1972, at which time he joined the University of California, Davis as an Assistant Professor.\n\nGardner performed research and teaching there for nearly 30 years, becoming Professor Emeritus in 2001 and returning as Research Professor in 2023. In 1982, while at University of California, Gardner founded the R&D firm Statistical Signal Processing, Inc. (SSPI), an engineering research services company working primarily with the national security sector but also the cellular RF communications industry. He served as the president, CEO, and chief scientist of SSPI for 25 years. He also founded several entrepreneurial ventures during the latter 15 years of that period, including Gardner Technologies in 2001 for which he served as IP inventor and chief technology officer for five years.\n\n Work \nAfter completing his Ph.D. dissertation entitled \"Representation and Estimation of Cyclostationary Processes,\" in 1972, Gardner began working on developing a new theory for the class of cyclostationary and polycyclostationary random processes.\n\nIn 1985, he wrote his first book, Introduction to Random Processes with Applications to Signals and Systems, which focused on the duality between the stochastic theory based on mathematical expectation and the nonstochastic (non-population) theory based on time averaging, which theory he was developing. Amir Atiya wrote \"The book is an excellent introduction to the theory of random processes... I recommend everyone working in the areas of signal processing and communications to own a copy.\" Lawrence Marple wrote \"The depth of coverage and the ease of readability can be compared to classic texts such as [A Papoulis's book which emphasizes theory and J Bendat & A Piersol's book which emphasizes estimation in practice]. The two chapters on stochastic calculus and the theory of duality and ergodicity are two of the most accessible and easy to understand presentations of these topics in a textbook... The book covers all key aspects of second order statistics of random processes using many examples and without the theoretical trappings of other introductory texts on this subject.\"\n\nGardner completed the fundamentals of his nonstochastic theory for stationary processes in 1984 and then reformulated all his research progress to date on cyclostationary stochastic processes within a nonstochastic framework: he developed the novel non-population theory of Fraction-of-Time (FOT) Probability for Poly-Cyclostationary time-series data.\n\nGardner's 1987 book Statistical Spectral Analysis: A Non-probabilistic Theory presented his FOT theory of both stationary and poly-cyclostationary processes and/or time-series in Part I and Part II, respectively.\n\nReviewing the book Statistical Spectral Analysis, Enders A Robinson wrote \"In this work Professor Gardner has made a significant contribution to statistical spectral analysis, one that would please the early pioneers of spectral theory and especially Norbert Wiener.\" James Massey wrote \"I admire the scholarship of this book and its radical departure from the stochastic process bandwagon of the past 40 years.\" Akiva Yaglom wrote \"It is important . . . that until Gardner's . . . book was published there was no attempt to present the modern spectral analysis of random processes consistently in language that uses only time-averaging rather than averaging over the statistical ensemble (population) of realizations [of a stochastic process] . . . Professor Gardner's book is a valuable addition to the literature\".\n\nGardner's contributions throughout the literature of the last 50 years are identified by Antonio Napolitano in Cyclostationary Processes and Time Series. In the book, Gardner's work has been cited over 500 times. Gardner provided the original definition and mathematical characterization of almost cyclostationary (ACS) stochastic processes, including poly-CS stochastic processes. He further gave the original definition and mathematical characterization of non-stochastic fraction-of-time (FOT) probabilistic models of CS, ACS, and poly-CS time-series. He also originated the extensions and generalizations of the core theorems and relations comprising the second order and higher-order theories of stationary stochastic processes and stationary non-stochastic time-series to CS, poly-CS, and ACS processes and times-series.\n\nIn 1987, Gardner was invited by the Editor of IEEE Signal Processing Magazine to write an introduction, for the signal processing community, to the recently discovered 1914 contribution of Albert Einstein to time-series analysis.  This introduction reveals the central role played by Professor Gardner's just-published time-average theory in understanding the relationship between Einstein's and Norbert Wiener's (1930) contributions to statistical spectral analysis.\n\nGardner won the international IEEE Stephen O. Rice Prize Paper award in communication theory in 1988 and the International EURASIP Best Paper of the Year Award in 1987; both papers treated his theory of cyclostationarity. Gardner and his students went on to further prove the uses of his theory of cyclostationarity in applications in communications and signals intelligence. Together with his doctoral student Chi Kang Chen, he wrote the book of mathematical problem solving, The Random Processes Tutor: A Comprehensive Solutions Manual for Independent Study in 1989.\n\nGardner, with the assistance of his doctoral student Chad Spooner, also generalized his theory from second-order to higher-order cyclostationarity in the early 1990s, and provided new insight into the statistical quantity called the cumulant. Later, he worked on cyclostationarity exploitation in the areas of enhanced radio reception for wireless communications and, more extensively, advanced RF signals intelligence. He was the editor and contributing author of the 1994 book, Cyclostationarity in Communications and Signal Processing. Douglas Cochran wrote \"this book is a timely contribution that should be a valuable reference for academic and industrial R&D engineers in signal processing and communication systems.\" This book was an outgrowth of the first international Workshop on Cyclostationary Signals in 1992, which was funded jointly by the National Science Foundation and the Offices of Research of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. Gardner served, by invitation of the NSF, as organizer and chair. His 2006 review paper, \"Cyclostationarity: Half a Century of Research\" received the Elsevier Most Cited Paper Award for multiple years.\n\nApplications of Gardner's theory include his discovery and development of the fundamental operational principles of cyclostationarity\u2014Insensitivity to Noise and Interference, and Selectivity/Separability of spectral correlation measurements and the signals themselves\u2014as well as demonstration of applicability to design and analysis of signal processing methods and algorithms for communications, telemetry, and radar systems. This body of work has demonstrated that substantial improvements in system performance can be obtained in various signal processing applications, such as detection, estimation, and classification of signals, by exploiting cyclostationarity\u2014that is, by recognizing and modeling the properties CS and ACS instead of using the stationary-process models which were the standard before Gardner. Major applications include cellular telephone, spectrum sensing\u2014for cognitive radio\u2014and signals intelligence for national security. Chapters 9 and 10 of the book survey fields of application of the cyclostationarity paradigm and identify on the order of 100 distinct areas of application and cite about 500 published papers addressing these applications. Gardner in 2016 developed the ad hoc concept of time de-warping into the basic theory of converting irregular cyclostationarity into regular cyclostationarity as a means for rendering the extensive and powerful tools of cyclostationary signal processing technology applicable to natural data exhibiting irregular cyclicity, which pervades essentially all fields of science as well as engineering.\n\n Other work \nGardner founded Gardner Technologies, Inc. and served as president and chief technical officer until 2006. Through Gardner Technologies, he ventured into more functional wine-packaging with patented wine bottle openers and closures. Upon terminating his brief cellular-telephone-technology venture with partner Stephen Schell, PureWave Technologies in 2001, he sold the IP to Apple.\n\n Awards and honors \n1986 - International Best-Paper-of-the-Year award from the European Association for Signal Processing\n1987 - Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award from the University of Massachusetts\n1988 - International Stephen O.

        "text": "Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as (Madrid, 22 October 1971) is a Spanish writer. Ma\u00f1as is often included as a member of the generation of neorealist Spanish writers from the 1990s, along with Juan Gracia, Gabriela Bustelo, Ray Loriga and Luc\u00eda Etxebarria. His books have been translated into several languages.\n\n Books \n\nMa\u00f1as achieved popular acclaim upon the publication of his literary debut Historias del Kronen. The novel, a finalist for the Premio Nadal literary prize in 1994, became a cult classic, particularly after the film adaptation by Spanish director Montxo Armend\u00e1riz. Three novels similar in style and content followed Historias del Kronen: Mensaka (1995), Ciudad Rayada (1998) and Sonko95 (1995). Autorretrato con negro de fondo (1999), together with Historias del Kronen, form the \"Kronen Tetralogy\" that Ma\u00f1as wrote about in the note at the end of Sonoko95, as follows:\n\nI like to say that these four novels are punk novels or \"nobelas\". I was thinking at that time that \"punk\" \u2014and when I used this concept I had in mind the music of the Ramones and the example of groups like the Velvet Underground\u2014 was the best way to describe what I was trying to do in writing. I thought that it was a good comparison that helped bring out the aesthetic qualities \u2014speed, authenticity and rawness\u2014 that I aim for in a novel. Over time I continued exploring the possibilities of this brilliant comparison and expanding on the idea, which is turning out to be more serious and useful than I had expected. For me a \"nobela\" melds all of the heteroglossic elements that modern fiction either ignores or puts between quotation marks. All of this \"noise\" \u2014and by \"noise\" I mean anything from bastardized spellings to colloquial mistakes and any kind of slang or language that is usually avoided in literature\u2014 is what a real novelist has to turn to if he wants to revitalize and pump new blood into a genre positioned like no other to give artistic shape to living language. \n\nOf the novels in the \"Kronen Tetralogy,\" Sonko95 stands out for the appearance of some of the most prominent characteristics that would come define to Ma\u00f1as' later works. In this respect, Sonko95 has a lot more to do with Soy un escritor frustrado, 1996, than with Historias del Kronen and Mensaka.\n\nIn fact in Soy un escritor frustrado, themes which are absent from Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as' first two novels, become permanent fixtures in Sonko95, Mundo Burbuja (2001) and Caso Karen (2005), in particular, his meta-literary character. Soy un escritor frustrado in fact describes his own writing process and he enjoys along the way reflecting on the highs and lows of success, which Ma\u00f1as himself has famously experienced first hand.\n\nIn Caso Karen, Ma\u00f1as rails without mercy against the modern literary scene and its most relevant institutions: authors, agents, publishing houses, prizes and conferences. Like in old pastoral romances, many of the characters from Caso Karen are depictions of real people: in \"Karen del Korral\" Luc\u00eda Etxebarria's personality traits are observed; \"Carina Martinell\" is Carmen Balcells; \"Armando Sala\" is Antonio Gala, etc. Additionally Caso Karen is structurally Ma\u00f1as most complex work.\n\nIn 2007 Manas published his first foray into historic fiction: El secreto del Or\u00e1culo (Ediciones Destino), based on Alexander the Great, was shortlisted for the 'Espartaco' prize for best historical novel.\n\nIn Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as' 2008 novel La pella, the writer has gone back to the style that made him famous, with his return to the world of realism.\n\nHis first entry outside of the fields of fiction and narrative is Un alma en incandescencia (2008), a book of aphorisms published by the Riojan publishing house Editorial Buscarini. The book was illustrated and inspired by the French artist Franciam Charlot.\n\n Film Adaptations \nHistorias del Kronen was Ma\u00f1as' first novel made into a movie and the screenplay earned him the respective Goya award.  In Montxo Armend\u00e1riz's adaptation, some of the intellectual references from the novel are missing, such as, the endless appearances of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho in the conversations between Carlos and Roberto.\n\nSalvador Garc\u00eda Ruiz realized the film version of Mensaka, which came out in 1998. Ma\u00f1as' novel Soy un escritor frustrado was made for the big screen with the title Imposture, directed by Patrick Bouchitey, and premiered in 2005, the same year that Caso Karen was published.\n\n Bibliography \n 1994 Historias del Kronen\n 1995 Mensaka\n 1996 Soy un escritor frustrado\n 1998 Ciudad Rayada\n 1999 Sonko95\n 2001 Mundo Burbuja\n 2005 Caso Karen\n 2007 A series of novellas El hombre de los 21 dedos, in collaboration with Antonio Dominguez Leiva\n 2007 El secreto del Or\u00e1culo\n 2008 La pella\n 2008 Un alma en incandescencia.

Chapters often end in a surprise or a cliffhanger as the story moves to follow another character.\n\nKeyes's knowledge of fencing and linguistics also figures heavily in his books. For example, Stephen Darige, one of the main characters in The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone, is an adept linguist, and his knowledge and skills play an important role in the development of the story.\n\nWorks\n\nChosen of the Changeling\nThe Waterborn (1996), \nThe Blackgod (1997), \n\nThe Age of Unreason\nNewton's Cannon (1998), \nA Calculus of Angels (1999), \nEmpire of Unreason (2000), \nThe Shadows of God (2001), \n\nBabylon 5: The Psi Corps Trilogy\nDark Genesis: The Birth of the Psi Corps (1998), \nDeadly Relations: Bester Ascendant (1999), \nFinal Reckoning: The Fate of Bester (1999), \n\nStar Wars: The New Jedi Order\nEdge of Victory I: Conquest (2001), \nEdge of Victory II: Rebirth (2001), \n\"Emissary of the Void\" (2002), short story published in Star Wars Gamer, issues 8-10, and Star Wars Insider, issues 62-64\nThe Final Prophecy (2003), \n\nThe Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone\nThe Briar King (2003), \nThe Charnel Prince (2004), \nThe Blood Knight (2006), \nThe Born Queen (2008), \n\nThe Elder Scrolls\nThe Infernal City (2009),  - based on The Elder Scrolls video game series\nLord of Souls (2011),  - based on The Elder Scrolls video game series\n\nThe High and Faraway Series\nThe Reign of the Departed (2018), \nKingdoms of the Cursed (2019), \n The Realm of the Deathless (2022)\n\nOther\nThe Hounds of Ash: and Other Tales of Fool Wolf (2008), \n Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: Firestorm (2014), \n XCOM 2: Resurrection (2015), \n Interstellar: The Movie Novelization (2014), \nIndependence Day: Crucible (2016), \n War for the Planet of the Apes: Revelations (2016), \nPlanet of the Apes: Caesar's Story (2018), Godzilla: King Of The Monsters - The Movie Novelization (2019)Marvel's Avengers: The Extinction Key (2020) Godzilla: Dominion (2021)  Godzilla vs. Kong: The Movie Novelization (2021)Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - The Movie Novelization'' (2024)\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website of Greg Keyes \nInterview with Greg Keyes conducted by Rob Bedford; at the SFF World website\nInterview with Greg Keyes at actusf.com\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1963 births\nCategory:20th-century American novelists\nCategory:21st-century American novelists\nCategory:American fantasy writers\nCategory:American male novelists\nCategory:American science fiction writers\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Mississippi State University alumni\nCategory:University of Georgia alumni\nCategory:People from Meridian, Mississippi\nCategory:Writers from Savannah, Georgia\nCategory:20th-century American male writers\nCategory:21st-century American male writers\nCategory:Novelists from Georgia (U.S. state)",

        "text": "Danica d'Hondt (born 29 May 1939) is an English-Canadian actress, writer, businesswoman and beauty pageant titleholder. She was a winner of the Miss Canada 1960 and represented her country at Miss World 1960 where she placed Top 18. She has worked in American television and film, and theater productions in the San Francisco area.\n\nBiography\nd'Hondt was born in London, England, of an Irish mother and a Belgian father. She is the sister of Canadian Olympic Gold Medalist Walter D'Hondt, the mother of actress America Olivo, the aunt of athlete Gillian d'Hondt, and mother-in-law of actors Christian Campbell and Jason Brooks.\n\nD'Hondt began her career at the age of nine by appearing in a movie at Shepperton Studios in England. She worked in radio, TV and on stage in Canada, where her family emigrated while she was still in school. She graduated from high school in Montreal, and returned to England after attending the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. She worked as a stage actress in London, also performing in radio and TV dramas for the BBC, and then relocated to Toronto, Canada, where she became a CBC-TV game show personality and a talk show host at an early age. She also appeared on TV shows out of New York City, and in summer stock theatre in New York and Illinois. She starred with comic Harvey Korman in Living Venus (1961), a film shot in Chicago in 1960.\n\nD'Hondt's Hollywood career spans the years from 1960 to 1990, during which time she starred in \"B\" movies, played supporting roles in major Hollywood movies, and performed guest-starring roles on TV shows of the time as The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964); The Wild Wild West (1965); Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964); and Tarzan (1966). She turned down the role of \"Ginger\" in Gilligan's Island (1964) because production stalled, which prevented her from doing other films.\n\nShe left Hollywood from 1966 to 1971, during which time she worked as a theatre director in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she also wrote for a magazine, produced educational films and taught acting at her own school, \"The Actor's Lab\", on Sacramento Street.\n\nUpon her return to Hollywood in 1971, she directed several stage productions, worked as a writer and associate producer in film and television, and did a stint as a television journalist, becoming the Consumer and Financial Reporter to a syndicated daytime magazine show called \"Breakaway\".\n\nShe relocated to Northern California in the 1990s, became active in real estate investing and had two non-fiction books published.\n\nD'Hondt is married to businessman and winemaker Nello Olivo, and they have six children together. The couple lives on a vineyard in the Sierra Foothills, where she writes, teaches, and helps tend their vineyard. The couple also owns a large restaurant and banquet facility in Placerville, California, named \"Sequoia\".\n\nFilmography\n1971: A Step Out of Line ... Doreen\n1966: Unkissed Bride ...

She won gold medals in the European U20 and U23 championships in the 10,000 m race walk and 20 km race walk respectively. Though she has never tested positive for an anti-doping violation, in May 2018 she was suspended from international competition due to participating in a training camp including banned coach Viktor Chegin.\n\n Career \n\nAfanasyeva began competing on the national level in 2012 as a sixteen-year-old, finishing fourth at the Russian Winter Race Walking Championship and later winning the Chuvash Republic Championships. Her first international competition was in 2013, when she finished 5th in the 5000 m race walk at the 2013 World Youth Championships in Athletics.\n\nIn 2016, the Russian Athletics Federation was banned from international competition from the IAAF for state-sponsored doping, meaning no Russian athletes were allowed to participate in the Olympics or any other international competition. In 2017, the IAAF began to accept a limited number of athletes training in Russia to compete as Authorized Neutral Athletes (ANA), and Afanasyeva was among the nineteen Russian athletes, and the only racewalker, cleared to compete in this manner at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.\n\nAt the 2017 World Championships, Afanasyeva competed in the 20 km walk. She was in the top ten at the 10 km split passed in 44:10, but she was ultimately one of six athletes disqualified for IAAF rule 230.6(a) \"Repeated failure to comply with the definition of Race Walking.\"\n\nIn May 2018, Afanasyeva's status as an Authorized Neutral Athlete was suspended by the IAAF, along with that of four other Russian racewalkers, for participating in an April training camp that included coach Viktor Chegin, who has received a lifetime ban from the sport. This prevented her from competing in any international competitions, including the 2018 IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships in China that month which she had qualified for.\n\nOn June 9, 2018, Afanasyeva returned to competition for the first time since 2017, winning the 50 km race walk at the Russian Race Walking Championship.\n\n References \n\nCategory:1996 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Russian female racewalkers\nCategory:World Athletics Championships athletes for Russia\nCategory:Authorised Neutral Athletes at the World Athletics Championships\nCategory:Russian Athletics Championships winners\nCategory:21st-century Russian sportswomen",

        "text": "Martin Kitchen (December 21, 1936, Nottingham, England) is a British-Canadian historian, who has  specialized in modern European history, with an emphasis on Germany. He is internationally regarded as a key author for the study of contemporary history.\n\nKitchen was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London.\n\nNow Professor Emeritus of history at Simon Fraser University, Kitchen started teaching in 1966. He also taught at the Cambridge Group for Population Studies (Cambridge University).\n\nThroughout his career, Kitchen has served in several editorial boards such as the International History Review, the Canadian Journal of History / Annales canadiennes d'histoire and International Affairs. Kitchen's work has been translated into French, German, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean and Chinese.\n\nFellowships and awards\nKitchen is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Historical Society. In 1978, he was awarded the Moncado Prize of The Society for Military History. In 1983-84, he received the Simon Fraser University Research Professor award.\n\nReviews\nKitchen received the following reviews for Speer: Hitler's Architect, a biography of the Nazi war criminal Albert Speer. Writing in 2016 Roger Moorhouse  for History Today said \"Kitchen is brilliant and brutal, exposing every aspect of his subject\u2019s story to stern scrutiny. He begins at the very start, showing that even Speer\u2019s tale of his birth was a lie.\" The Kirkus Review said \"Kitchen sets the record straight on Albert Speer\u2019s assertions of ignorance of the Final Solution and claims to being the good Nazi.\" Jonathan Meades writing in the London Review of Books said \"Speer: Hitler\u2019s Architect is not a biography. It is a 200,000-word charge sheet. Kitchen is steely, dogged and attentive to the small print. He shows Speer no mercy, nailing his every exculpatory ruse and demonstrating time and again how provisional the notion of truth was to him.\n\nBooks\n The Dominici Affair: Murder and Mystery in Provence (Lincoln, Nebraska: Potomac Books, 2017) \n Speer: Hitler's Architect, Description & Contents.

        "text": "Guillaume Cailleau (born 15 February 1978 in Saumur) is a French artist, filmmaker and producer whose interest lies in exploring new forms to address political and social issues.\n\n Biography \nFrom 2006 to 2011 Guillaume Cailleau studied at the Berlin University of the Arts and was a postgraduate student under Heinz Emigholz. Before his art studies he graduated as an engineer from Icam in Nantes. He also worked as a cinema projectionist in Paris and Berlin.\n\nIn 2007 Guillaume Cailleau shot his first short film Blitzkrieg, which premiered at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Other films followed, such as Through, a reference to Michael Snow's installation Windowed Water (2007), the manually processed film H(I)J (2009), and Austerity Measures (2012), a collaboration with Ben Russell shot in Athens. In February 2014 Guillaume Cailleau was awarded a Silver Bear for his short film Laborat at the Berlinale Film Festival.\nSince 2009 Guillaume Cailleau has been a member of the independent film collective LaborBerlin. As a freelance video artist, he has worked in theater productions by Thomas Ostermeier, Hakan Sava\u015f Mican und Mala Kline. In addition Cailleau developed numerous audiovisual performances, for instance with the experimental sound artist Werner Dafeldecker and the composer and conductor Timo Kreuser which were featured at international venues such as the Edinburgh International Film Festival (2014), Scratch Expanded Paris (2013) and COLOR SOUND FRAMES (2015) at Serralves Museum.\n\nIn addition to his own artistic practice, Cailleau successfully produces films with his company CASKFILMS, collaborating with artists such as Ben Russell, Gustavo Jahn, Sasha Litvintseva & Beny Wagner and Lucile Desamory. Cailleau is co-producer of Ben Russell's Film \"Good Luck\" (2017), which premiered at the Locarno Festival and was shown as a 4-channel video installation at documenta 14 in Kassel.\n\n Style \nGuillaume Cailleau's work is influenced by American avant-garde cinema and performative practices in Expanded Cinema. Experimenting with duration, multiple exposures, color separation and manually treated single images, in addition to other methods of image editing, the forms of his films relate directly to their subjects. The process of filmmaking is often foregrounded in the artist's poetic compositions.\n\n Filmography (selection) \n 2007: Blitzkrieg (short film, Premiere 54.

He left the unification government in 1993, sparking the 1994 civil war in Yemen and then went into exile in Oman. He is a leader of the Southern independence movement known as Al Hirak.\n\nLeadership in South Yemen\nHe studied for a Commerce degree and became a School Teacher in Mukalla in 1961. He joined the National Liberation Front in 1963 as the Local Committee founder in Mukalla, and went underground in 1965. In 1966 he was admitted into the Hadramawt Provincial Committee of the NLF. After independence, he joined the YSP. In 1971 he was selected as the General Secretary of the Hadhramawt Provincial Committee and was admitted into the YSP National Central Committee as a Candidate-Member. Selected as Full Member of the Central Committee in 1975, well as Deputy Minister for School Education and Vocational Training. In 1977, he was admitted as Candidate Member for the YSP Politburo and a full Politburo member in 1981. Ali took the top position in the YSP following a 12-day 1986 civil war between forces loyal to former chairman Abdul Fattah Ismail and then-chairman Ali Nasir Muhammad. An Ismail ally, he took control after Muhammad's defeat and defection and Ismail's disappearance.Busky, Donald, Communism in history and theory: Asia, Africa, and the Americas, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, page 74Rouhollah K.

But in 1993, Ali quit the government and returned to the former Southern capital of Aden, claiming that the new government was systematically marginalizing the southern people and ignoring the needs of the south. On 21 May 1994, as the South's military position weakened, Ali declared the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He served as the only President of the DRY, from 21 May to 7 July 1994. Ali fled to neighbouring Oman after the secession failed.\n\nSouth Yemen movement\nAfter fifteen years of living in exile, Ali Salim al-Beidh resumed his political career on the eve of the 19th anniversary of the Yemeni unification. This came amid highly escalating tensions in the south, with clashes and violence between protesters and Yemeni security forces. In a televised speech from Kitzb\u00fchel, Austria, the former President called for a return of South Yemen. Since then he has called for several demonstrations to demonstrate the strength of the movement.Rally in Aden These have continued into 2011. As a result of his increased involvement, he lost his right to stay in Oman after violating the conditions of his citizenship.

        "text": "Bob B Boilen (born April 10, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York City) is an American musician and media personality. He was the host and creator of NPR's online music show All Songs Considered and the co-creator of NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts, a series originally conceived of by NPR's Stephen Thompson. He retired from NPR in October 2023 after 35 years.\n\nSince 2021, Boilen has hosted the weekly show My Tiny Morning Show on WOWD-LP. He will become the station's program director in June 2024.\n\n Career \nIn 1978, Bob Boilen played synthesizers in the Washington, D.C. band Tiny Desk Unit. They were the first band to ever play the 9:30 Club at the original location at 930 'F' Street. From 1982 to 1986, Boilen filled a variety of roles including composer with Baltimore's Impossible Theater. He also worked as a producer for Channel 50, and produced Science Live for the Discovery Channel. He joined NPR in 1988 and \"was hired to work on the flagship news program All Things Considered on a temporary basis. Less than a year later, he became the director of the show\". He held that position until 2007. As director, Boilen chose the music between the news stories for that show. Those musical snippets, or \"buttons\", were the starting point for the creation of the show All Songs Considered in 2000. He then helped create NPR Music in 2007.\n\nBoilen co-created and produced the Tiny Desk Concert series in April 2008 for NPR Music, hosting intimate performances at his desk. The series, curated by Boilen and the team of NPR Music, was inspired by a comment made by NPR Music's Stephen Thompson when he jokingly invited musician Laura Gibson to perform at Bob's desk. The two of them went to see Gibson at a show at South by Southwest in 2008 and the loud crowd made it impossible to hear her. The series is named after the band Boilen played in from 1979 to 1981, Tiny Desk Unit. He retired from NPR on October 2, 2023.\n\nSince August 2021, he has hosted a weekly morning show on WOWD-LP, a low-power FM station in Takoma Park, Maryland. In April 2024, it was announced he would become program director at the station effective June 1, 2024.\n\nBob Boilen continues to play music with friend Michael Barron; both were founding members of the psychedelic dance band Tiny Desk Unit (1979\u20131981), for which Boilen played synthesizer. Boilen continues to write music with Barron in a band called Danger Painters and also writes and releases solo music. Boilen also composed the original theme music for Talk of the Nation.\n\nHe voiced himself in \"Gal of Constant Sorrow\", a Season 27 episode of the animated television series The Simpsons.\n\n References \n\n External links \n Bob Boilen's homepage\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:NPR personalities\nCategory:1953 births\nCategory:Musicians from Brooklyn\nCategory:Mass media people from Brooklyn\nCategory:American male composers\nCategory:Radio personalities from New York City",

        "text": "Sir Gareth Owen Edwards  (born 12 July 1947) is a Welsh former rugby union player who played scrum-half and has been described by the BBC as \"arguably the greatest player ever to don a Welsh jersey\".\n\nIn 2003, in a poll of international rugby players conducted by Rugby World magazine, Edwards was declared the greatest player of all time. In 2007, former England captain Will Carling published his list of the '50 Greatest Rugby players' in The Daily Telegraph, and ranked Edwards the greatest player ever, stating; \"He was a supreme athlete with supreme skills, the complete package. He played in the 1970s, but, if he played now, he would still be the best. He was outstanding at running, passing, kicking and reading the game. He sits astride the whole of rugby as the ultimate athlete on the pitch\".\n\nEdwards was prominent in the Wales national team that was to the fore in European rugby in the '60s and '70s. He is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams including Gerald Davies, JPR Williams, Ryan Jones, Adam Jones, Gethin Jenkins and Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nEdwards was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1975 Birthday Honours for services to Welsh rugby football;United Kingdom list:  he was promoted to Commander (CBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours, \"for services to sport, particularly rugby.\"United Kingdom: \nHe was knighted in the 2015 Birthday Honours, for services to sport and for charitable services.United Kingdom: \n\nEarly life\n\nEdwards was born a miner's son in Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen, Glamorgan, Wales. He attended Pontardawe Technical School for Boys (now Cwmtawe Community School), where he was taken under the wing of sports teacher Bill Samuels.\n\nHe won a scholarship to the elite Millfield Public School in Somerset. Apart from rugby, Edwards showed promise in a wide range of sports, playing for West Wales Youth football team, and signing for Swansea Town at the age of 16. He also showed prowess in gymnastics and athletics.\n\nPlaying career\n\nWales\nthumb|upright|left|Image of Edwards on a wall at Cardiff Arms Park, 2007\n\nEdwards won his first international cap for Wales on 1 April 1967 at the age of 19 against France in Paris. Wales lost 20\u201314 to eventual championship winners France. Between 1967 and 1978 Edwards won 53 caps for Wales, including 13 as captain. All his caps were won in succession; he never had a dip in form or an injury that would allow anybody else to take his place. He scored twenty tries in internationals.\n\nEdwards is Wales's youngest ever captain, first taking the captaincy at the age of 20 in February 1968 against Scotland \u2013 a game which the Welsh side won 5\u20130. Edwards was very fortunate in playing with two of the best outside halves the game has ever seen: Barry John and Phil Bennett. In the early part of his career, Edwards and his club teammate Barry John appeared inseparable, always knowing what the other was doing. During his era the Welsh side dominated the Five Nations Championship, winning the title seven times, including three grand slams. In 1969, Edwards was named Player of the Year in Wales.\n\nIn 1974 Edwards was named BBC Wales Sports Personality of the year. He followed up this success by receiving the MBE in 1975.\n\nHe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1976 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\nEdwards' long successful international career came to an end on 18 March 1978 in the same way as he had started his career \u2013 against France in the Five Nations Championship. However, unlike on his debut, Edwards celebrated with a 16\u20137 winning finish in front of a home crowd at the Arms Park in Cardiff. Wales also sealed the Grand Slam and a third consecutive Triple Crown \u2013 a record, given that no team had ever won it more than twice in a row. To crown his achievements he was named Rothmans Player of the Year 1978.\n\nBritish and Irish Lions\n\nEdwards also played ten times for the British & Irish Lions in test matches, playing for the 1971 Lions team that was the only such team to win a series in New Zealand, and for the unbeaten 1974 side in South Africa. Edwards also played in 28 non-test matches for the Lions and scored 16 tries in these fixtures.\n\nCardiff RFC\n\nHe made his debut for Cardiff RFC against Coventry on 17 September 1966 and he played 12 seasons for Cardiff, scoring 69 tries in 195 games.\n\nOther\n\nEdwards also played for Cardiff College, Wales Secondary Schools, East Wales, Wales, Barbarians, Wolfhounds, Irish President XV, World XV in South Africa in 1977, the combined England and Wales against Scotland and Ireland at the RFU centenary in 1971, first Wales Sevens team SRU centenary in 1973, and the RAF (though not in the Services) on tour in Cyprus 1972.\n\nThat Try\n\nEdwards' try for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in 1973 at Cardiff Arms Park, often referred to simply as \"that try\", is regarded as the greatest try ever. The move starts with a deep kick from the New Zealand winger. The ball dropped towards Phil Bennett near to his goal line. Bennett sidestepped and evaded three tackles, in turn passing the ball to JPR Williams. It next passed through four pairs of hands (John Pullin, John Dawes, Tommy David and Derek Quinnell) before Edwards, slipping between two teammates and seemingly intercepting the last pass, finished with a diving try in the left-hand corner.\n\nIn a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002 British rugby supporters voted Edwards's historic try for the Barbarians No. 20 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.\n\nPost-playing career\n\nthumb|upright|The sculpture of Gareth Edwards in St David's Centre\nthumb|Video of Edwards talking to the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford\nWhen he wrote his autobiography he was branded a \"professional\" and was temporarily prevented from coaching or being involved in any way with the sport of rugby union.\n\nFrom 1978 until 1982 Edwards was a team captain on the TV quiz show A Question of Sport along with Liverpool and England footballer Emlyn Hughes.\n\nIn 1997, Edwards was one of the first fifteen former players inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame along with (among others) former playing partners Barry John and JPR Williams. He is also the subject of a plaque in the Rugby Pathway of Fame in the town of Rugby, Warwickshire, which is credited as the home of the game.\n\nOn 21 November 2001, Edwards was voted the \"Greatest Welsh Player of all time\" at a rugby dinner held at the Cardiff International Arena by the 'Welsh Rugby Former International Players' Association' and First Press Events company.

Apart from rugby, Edwards showed promise in a wide range of sports, playing for West Wales Youth football team, and signing for Swansea Town at the age of 16. He also showed prowess in gymnastics and athletics.\n\nPlaying career\n\nWales\nthumb|upright|left|Image of Edwards on a wall at Cardiff Arms Park, 2007\n\nEdwards won his first international cap for Wales on 1 April 1967 at the age of 19 against France in Paris. Wales lost 20\u201314 to eventual championship winners France. Between 1967 and 1978 Edwards won 53 caps for Wales, including 13 as captain. All his caps were won in succession; he never had a dip in form or an injury that would allow anybody else to take his place. He scored twenty tries in internationals.\n\nEdwards is Wales's youngest ever captain, first taking the captaincy at the age of 20 in February 1968 against Scotland \u2013 a game which the Welsh side won 5\u20130. Edwards was very fortunate in playing with two of the best outside halves the game has ever seen: Barry John and Phil Bennett. In the early part of his career, Edwards and his club teammate Barry John appeared inseparable, always knowing what the other was doing. During his era the Welsh side dominated the Five Nations Championship, winning the title seven times, including three grand slams. In 1969, Edwards was named Player of the Year in Wales.\n\nIn 1974 Edwards was named BBC Wales Sports Personality of the year. He followed up this success by receiving the MBE in 1975.\n\nHe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1976 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\nEdwards' long successful international career came to an end on 18 March 1978 in the same way as he had started his career \u2013 against France in the Five Nations Championship. However, unlike on his debut, Edwards celebrated with a 16\u20137 winning finish in front of a home crowd at the Arms Park in Cardiff. Wales also sealed the Grand Slam and a third consecutive Triple Crown \u2013 a record, given that no team had ever won it more than twice in a row. To crown his achievements he was named Rothmans Player of the Year 1978.\n\nBritish and Irish Lions\n\nEdwards also played ten times for the British & Irish Lions in test matches, playing for the 1971 Lions team that was the only such team to win a series in New Zealand, and for the unbeaten 1974 side in South Africa. Edwards also played in 28 non-test matches for the Lions and scored 16 tries in these fixtures.\n\nCardiff RFC\n\nHe made his debut for Cardiff RFC against Coventry on 17 September 1966 and he played 12 seasons for Cardiff, scoring 69 tries in 195 games.\n\nOther\n\nEdwards also played for Cardiff College, Wales Secondary Schools, East Wales, Wales, Barbarians, Wolfhounds, Irish President XV, World XV in South Africa in 1977, the combined England and Wales against Scotland and Ireland at the RFU centenary in 1971, first Wales Sevens team SRU centenary in 1973, and the RAF (though not in the Services) on tour in Cyprus 1972.\n\nThat Try\n\nEdwards' try for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in 1973 at Cardiff Arms Park, often referred to simply as \"that try\", is regarded as the greatest try ever. The move starts with a deep kick from the New Zealand winger. The ball dropped towards Phil Bennett near to his goal line. Bennett sidestepped and evaded three tackles, in turn passing the ball to JPR Williams. It next passed through four pairs of hands (John Pullin, John Dawes, Tommy David and Derek Quinnell) before Edwards, slipping between two teammates and seemingly intercepting the last pass, finished with a diving try in the left-hand corner.\n\nIn a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002 British rugby supporters voted Edwards's historic try for the Barbarians No. 20 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.\n\nPost-playing career\n\nthumb|upright|The sculpture of Gareth Edwards in St David's Centre\nthumb|Video of Edwards talking to the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford\nWhen he wrote his autobiography he was branded a \"professional\" and was temporarily prevented from coaching or being involved in any way with the sport of rugby union.\n\nFrom 1978 until 1982 Edwards was a team captain on the TV quiz show A Question of Sport along with Liverpool and England footballer Emlyn Hughes.\n\nIn 1997, Edwards was one of the first fifteen former players inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame along with (among others) former playing partners Barry John and JPR Williams. He is also the subject of a plaque in the Rugby Pathway of Fame in the town of Rugby, Warwickshire, which is credited as the home of the game.\n\nOn 21 November 2001, Edwards was voted the \"Greatest Welsh Player of all time\" at a rugby dinner held at the Cardiff International Arena by the 'Welsh Rugby Former International Players' Association' and First Press Events company.

        "text": "Donald Francis McGahn II ( ; born June 16, 1968) is an American lawyer who served as White House counsel for U.S. President Donald Trump, from the day of Trump's inauguration through October 17, 2018, when McGahn resigned. Previously, McGahn served on the Federal Election Commission for over five years. In November 2019, McGahn received a court order to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives. In August 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 7\u20132 that the House can sue him to comply.\n\nEarly life and education\nDon McGahn was born on June 16, 1968, and grew up in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the son of Noreen () and Donald F. McGahn.\"Jean Quinn Rogan Obituary\", Citizens' Voice via Legacy.com, May 19, 2014. He is a nephew of Joseph McGahn, former Democratic New Jersey State Senator and medical director at Donald Trump's Resorts International, and Atlantic City attorney Patrick McGahn, who had represented Trump's casino interests from 1982 until Trump sued him for alleged overbilling in 1995.\n\nDon McGahn attended Our Lady Star of the Sea School in Atlantic City and Holy Spirit High School in nearby Absecon.DeRosier, John. \"Atlantic City native embroiled in Trump/Flynn controversy \", The Press of Atlantic City, May 17, 2017. Accessed November 15, 2017. \"McGahn, a longtime Republican campaign lawyer and former commissioner at the Federal Election Commission, grew up in Atlantic City, attending Our Lady Star of the Sea school and Holy Spirit High School, where he played football.\" He briefly attended the United States Naval Academy before transferring to the University of Notre Dame. At the  University of Notre Dame he received a B.A. degree in history and computer applications. He obtained his J.D. degree from Widener University Commonwealth Law School in 1994. In 2002, later in his career, he earned an LL.M. degree from the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nCareer\nAfter graduation from law school, McGahn worked in campaign finance law at the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Patton Boggs. From 1999 to 2008, McGahn was chief counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).\n\nGeorge W. Bush nominated McGahn as a Republican-selected member of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in 2008. He was confirmed on June 24, 2008, by the United States Senate and was sworn in shortly thereafter. He is credited as having played a crucial role in loosening regulations on campaign spending. According to documentary footage in the 2018 film Dark Money, McGahn's brief period as incoming chair of the Commission ushered in a newly partisan rigor to the FEC whereby he and his two fellow Republican members, also new, formed an unprecedented lockstep voting bloc preventing any and all enforcement of FEC regulations. McGahn resigned from the FEC in September 2013.\n\nAfter leaving the FEC, McGahn returned to the law firm Patton Boggs. In 2014 he moved to the law firm of Jones Day in Washington, D.C. He also worked for the Koch affiliated Freedom Partners. McGahn brought five Jones Day lawyers with him to the White House, and six more were appointed to senior posts in the Trump Administration.\n\n Donald Trump 2016 Presidential campaign \nMcGahn served as Donald Trump's campaign counsel during his 2016 campaign for president. McGahn managed all litigation involving Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign. Early in 2016, he stopped efforts to keep Trump off of the Republican primary ballot in New Hampshire by going to court and winning to ensure ballot access in a key primary state. Several weeks before the election, lawsuits were filed in four battleground states alleging voter intimidation and seeking to enjoin the Trump campaign from having observers at polling locations. McGahn successfully managed and won these litigations.\n\n Trump presidency \nShortly after Trump was elected, he named McGahn General Counsel of the Presidential Transition Team. On November 25, 2016, McGahn was named White House Counsel for the President-elect's new administration.\n\nSince Jones Day has also represented the Trump campaign in its dealings with Robert Mueller, McGahn secured an ethics waiver that allows him to talk to his old firm when its clients have business before the U.S. government.\n\nleft|thumb|upright|Don McGahn at the Marine Barracks Washington Sunset Parade on June 6, 2017\nMcGahn personally recommended Trump nominate Neil Gorsuch to replace Antonin Scalia and Brett Kavanaugh to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Gorsuch's first official interview with Trump staff was on January 5, 2017, when McGahn met with him in Trump Tower.  Trump and McGahn met with him on January 14, 2017. McGahn called Gorsuch on January 27, 2017, to tell him that he had been selected as the nominee. Gorsuch was sworn in on Monday April 10, 2017. McGahn also recommended the nomination of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. Acosta was sworn in on April 28, 2017.\n\nMcGahn assembled a team of lawyers to oversee filling all judicial vacancies.  Guided by McGahn's team, President Trump had already appointed ten appellate judges by November 11, 2017, the most that early in a presidency since Richard Nixon.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, McGahn conveyed instructions from President Trump to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, requesting Sessions not to recuse himself from overseeing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. McGahn was unaware that Sessions had already consulted with career attorneys at the Department of Justice.  When Sessions informed him he had already decided to recuse himself, McGahn ceased further discussion of the topic. In response to this, Walter Shaub, former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics, said McGahn had \"done much to undermine anticorruption mechanisms in this country.\" Shaub said, \"It is a crime for a federal employee to participate in a particular matter in which he has a financial interest.\"\n\nIn January 2018 The New York Times reported that in June 2017, the president asked McGahn to instruct top Justice Department officials to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller, and that McGahn refused, instead threatening to resign.\n\nThe New York Times reported on August 18, 2018, that McGahn had been cooperating extensively with the Special Counsel investigation for several months and that he and his lawyer had become concerned that Trump \"had decided to let Mr. McGahn take the fall for decisions that could be construed as obstruction of justice, like the Comey firing, by telling the special counsel that he was only following shoddy legal advice from Mr. McGahn.\"\n\nOn August 29, 2018, President Trump announced \"McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!\" McGahn formally departed the Trump administration on October 17, 2018.\n\nIn November 2018 it was reported that in spring 2018, Trump told McGahn that he wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. McGahn told Trump that he had no authority to order a prosecution and that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo to Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face possible impeachment.\n\nDon McGahn returned to Jones Day in March 2019 as the head of the firm's Government Regulation Practice.\n\nAccording to Mueller's final report, McGahn complained to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus that Trump was trying to get him to \"do crazy shit.\"  The president responded that McGahn was a \"lying bastard.\"Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman. \"A Portrait of the White House and Its Culture of Dishonesty\" The New York Times April 18, 2019.Trump: Witness to My Crime Can't Testify, But Trust Me He's Lying, New York Magazine, Jonathan Chait, June 14, 2019. Retrieved June 17, 2019.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, the White House instructed McGahn not to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the committee to redirect its records requests related to Mueller's investigation to the White House; McGahn is the most cited witness in the Mueller Report. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referenced the action as an obstruction of justice, stating during an event  at Cornell University, \"Trump is goading us to impeach him[.]\"Desiderio, A, et al \"Don McGahn won't comply with House Democrats' subpoena\", by ANDREW DESIDERIO and KYLE CHENEY, May 7, 2019.

Retrieved May 7, 2019. A week later, it was reported that Trump's lawyers believed that McGahn told Mueller he did not believe Trump obstructed the investigation and ordered him not to provide any documents he had to the Judiciary Committee. On May 21, 2019, McGahn defied a subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, at the direction of his former client.  On August 7, the House filed a lawsuit with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in an effort to challenge this precedent-setting move.\n\nCongressional subpoena\n\nOn November 25, 2019, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled that McGahn, who the Trump administration ordered not to cooperate with the investigation, must cooperate with the investigation and comply with a House of Representatives subpoena to testify. The Justice Department requested a stay pending an appeal of the ruling, but on December 2, Jackson rejected the request, calling the DOJ's assertion that the House Judiciary Committee would not be harmed by a stay \"disingenuous.\" Jackson wrote, \"DOJ's argument here that any further delay will not be harmful to the Judiciary Committee because, in essence, DOJ has already harmed the Committee's interests by successfully delaying its access to other materials strikes this Court as an unacceptable mischaracterization of the injury at issue.\"\n\nOn February 28, 2020, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed that judgment and ordered the House's lawsuit dismissed.  Circuit Judge Thomas B. Griffith, joined by Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, determined that the separation of powers under the United States Constitution does not allow Congress to use the Courts to force Executive officials to testify.  Judge Henderson wrote a concurrence in which she argued the House simply did not have standing to sue in this instance. Judge Judith W. Rogers wrote a dissent.\n\nOn appeal from the House, on March 13, 2020, the full Court agreed to reconsider the case. On August 7, the full Court ruled that the House of Representatives could sue to enforce the subpoena, but then, on August 31, the court ruled that the House had never been legally empowered by Congress to sue to enforce subpoenas.\n\n Personal life \nMcGahn is married to Shannon McGahn, a lobbyist and former Counselor to Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. They have two sons. He is a Roman Catholic. McGahn has played guitar for more than 20 years and studied at Berklee College of Music. He plays lead guitar for an act called Scott's New Band.\n\n See also \nRussian interference in the 2016 United States elections\n\n References \n\nFurther reading\n\n Paperback title: The greatest show on Earth : The deals, the downfall, the reinvention\n\nExternal links\n\n Trump Needs a Strong Lawyer: White House Counsel McGahn has been conspicuously absent from Bloomberg Businessweek\n \n  Address and Q&A at Oxford Union, April 2019\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\nCategory:1968 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:20th-century American lawyers\nCategory:21st-century American lawyers\nCategory:Georgetown University Law Center alumni\nCategory:Holy Spirit High School (New Jersey) alumni\nCategory:Jones Day people\nCategory:Members of the Federal Election Commission\nCategory:New Jersey lawyers\nCategory:New Jersey Republicans\nCategory:People from Atlantic City, New Jersey\nCategory:First Trump administration personnel\nCategory:United States Naval Academy alumni\nCategory:University of Notre Dame alumni\nCategory:Widener University alumni\nCategory:White House counsels\nCategory:Catholics from New Jersey\nCategory:Widener University Commonwealth Law School alumni\nCategory:George W.

Kuper remarked on this, \"I initially put comics on one side and my illustration in another compartment, but over the years I found that it was difficult to compartmentalize like that. The two have merged together so that they're really inseparable.\"\n\nKuper has taught comics and illustration courses at the Parsons School of Design, and The School of Visual Arts and Harvard University\u2019s first class dedicated to graphic novels.\n\nIn April 2022, Kuper was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA's benefit anthology book, Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

        "text": "Nyasha Liberty Mushekwi (born 21 August 1987) is a Zimbabwean professional footballer who plays as a forward for China League One club Dalian K'un City.\n\nCareer\nBorn in Harare, Mushekwi started out playing for CAPS United in his homeland Zimbabwe. He won the top scorer award after scoring 21 league goals for the Harare giants in 2009 season.\n\nIn 2010, he made the move to South African club Mamelodi Sundowns where he found immediate success when he became the second best goalscorer of the 2010\u201311 Premier Soccer League season. In April 2013, as his contract was nearing its end, Mamelodi Sundowns extended the deal with another year plus an option for an additional second year.\n\nFor the 2013\u201314 season, Mushekwi was sent on loan to Belgian club K.V. Oostende, but in February 2014 he suffered an injury from which he did not recover until November. Since his South African club had already used all its foreign player slots for the season, he could not be registered to play for them once he had recovered from injury. In an effort to find a new club in 2015, Mushekwi went on trial with Hobro IK in Denmark. However, he signed with Swedish club Djurg\u00e5rdens IF, which contacted him while he was in Denmark and brought him to Sweden for a trial, resulting in a 6-month loan deal.\n\n China \nOn 22 December 2015, Mushekwi transferred to China League One side Dalian Yifang.\u5927\u8fde\u4e00\u65b9\u7eed\u7ea6\u4e3b\u5e05\u65af\u5854\u52d2 \u745e\u8d85\u4e24\u5927\u950b\u9738\u6b63\u5f0f\u52a0\u76df at sports.sohu.com 22 December 2015. Retrieved 22 December 2015 He was the top goal scorer in the team for 3 consecutive seasons. However, he suffered a few serious injuries later, from which his physical condition was affected.\n\nIn the 2017 season, he was once tackled brutally in the right leg, but volunteered to stay on the pitch, and scored an important goal. He eventually helped Yifang win the League One title. In 2018, he was not the preferred player at first competing with Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n and Yannick Carrasco, but he won a position by continuous goals. He had pelvis injuries during the season. Again he tried to stay in the game after a heavy collision in the head with opponent goalkeeper. Overall, his strong spirit gained high reputation among local fans, and was regarded as one of the most important players in team history.\n\nIn the 2019 season, his performance was below expectation after the surgery. On 15 July 2019, Mushekwi joined China League One side Zhejiang Greentown. He would play a vital part as the club gained promotion to the top tier at the end of the 2021 campaign.\n\nOn 1 March 2024, Mushekwi joined China League One club Yunnan Yukun.\n\nInternational career\nMushekwi is a member of the Zimbabwe national football team. He was involved in the Asiagate scandal but avoided a lifetime ban from international football after volunteering information in the investigation.\n\nPersonal life\nMushekwi attended Churchill School where his main sport was basketball. He was voted the most valuable player of the Mashonaland Basketball Association League and represented Zimbabwe at under-19 and senior national team level in the sport.\n\nCareer statistics\n\n+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competitionClubSeasonLeagueNational CupLeague CupContinentalOtherTotalDivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsCAPS United2007ZPSL162\u2014\u2014\u2014\u20141622008187\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201418720092121\u2014\u20143All appearance(s) in CAF Confederation Cup0\u201424212010135\u2014\u201441\u2014176Total6835\u2014\u201471\u20147536Mamelodi Sundowns2010\u201311SAPD27141021\u20141All appearance(s) in MTN 8 Cup029152011\u20131228941010\u20142035192012\u2013132553040\u201421346Total802891150\u2014519940K.V.

        "text": "Hamadi Jebali (, ; born 12 January 1949) is a Tunisian engineer, Muslim politician and journalist who was Prime Minister of Tunisia from December 2011 to March 2013. He was the Secretary-General of the Ennahda Movement, a moderate Islamic party in Tunisia, until he left his party in December 2014 in the course of the 2014 Tunisian presidential election.\n\nEarly life, education and professional life\nBorn in Sousse in 1949, Jebali received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the Tunis University and added a masters programme in photovoltaic engineering in Paris, France. As a specialist in solar energy and wind power, he founded his own enterprise in Sousse.\n\n Personal life \nHamadi Jebali comes from a family of six children: four girls and two boys. \nincluding his brother, Ali Jebali, he is a well-known figure in Tunisia, active in professional and public affairs. \nIn 1957, his father, a carpenter in Sousse and a staunch Youssefist, was arrested and imprisoned; he helped his family bring a modest supply basket to his father at Habs Al Mokhtar prison.\n\nPolitical and journalistic activity\nIn 1981 he became involved with Tunisia's Islamist movement, then called Movement of the Islamic Tendency. He was director and editor-in-chief of Al-Fajr (Dawn), the former weekly newspaper of the Islamist Ennahda Party. Moreover, he served as longtime member of the party's executive council and remains secretary-general of Ennahda.Case Information: Hamadi Jebali, Committee on Human Rights, nationalacademies.org. Retrieved on 26 October 2011.\n\nCriminal prosecution and imprisonment\nIn June 1990, Al-Fajr published an article by Rashid al-Ghannushi called \"The people of the State or the State of the People?\" Jebali was made responsible for the publication and received a suspended sentence and a 1,500 dinars fine for the offences of \"encouraging violation of the law\" and \"calling for insurrection\". In November 1990, the Islamist newspaper contained an essay by the lawyer Mohammed Nouri, entitled \"When will military courts, serving as special courts, be abolished?\" This time, a military court sentenced Hamadi Jebali to one year in prison for \"defamation of a judicial institution\".\n\nIn May 1992 the government claimed that it had detected plans for a coup d'\u00e9tat by Ennahda, which had allegedly plotted to kill President Ben Ali and establish an Islamic state. In August 1992, Jebali, along with 170 other sympathisers of Ennahda, was charged with \"attempted overthrow\". Jebali protested that he had no knowledge of the plot's existence, and asserted that he had been tortured, presenting marks on his body for evidence. The trial was classified as unfair by observers for Human Rights Watch, the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, and Amnesty International, the latter of which named Jebali a prisoner of conscience. Eventually, on 28 August 1992 Hamadi Jebali was sentenced to a prison term of 16 years for \"membership in an illegal organisation\" and \"attempted change of the nature of the state\". The Court of Cassation confirmed the verdict.\n\nThe conditions of his imprisonment were harsh. More than ten of the 15 years that Jebali spent, were in solitary confinement. Hamadi Jebali engaged in several hunger strikes to protest against the conditions and his conviction. Two of them lasted for 36 days each. In February 2006, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Tunisia's independence, Jebali was conditionally released.\n\nPost-revolution and Prime Minister\nthumb|200px|Jebali during the WEF 2012\nFollowing the Tunisian revolution in January 2011, Ennahda was legalised. Since then, Hamadi Jebali has been present in public as the party's secretary-general and spokesman. In May 2011, he went to Washington, D.C. in the US at the invitation of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy. He also met U.S. Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman.\n\nEnsuing Ennahda's success in the Constituent Assembly election on 23 October 2011, the party nominated him as its candidate for prime minister. Jebali is considered a proponent of the reformist wing of his party.\n\nInterim President Moncef Marzouki appointed Jebali as Prime Minister of Tunisia on 14 December 2011. He presented his government on 20 December. He officially took office on 24 December.\n\nOn 19 February 2013, he resigned from his office. The move followed his attempt to form a technocratic government following the assassination of Chokri Belaid and ensuing protests against the alleged Islamisation of the country. Ennahda, however, rejected his resignation insisting on a government of politicians and Jebali formally resigned after a meeting with President Moncef Marzouki saying it was in the best interests of the country. He said: \"I promised if my initiative did not succeed I would resign as head of the government, and this is what I am doing following my meeting with the president. Today there is a great disappointment among the people and we must regain their trust and this resignation is a first step.\" Party leader Rachid Ghannouchi then suggested a government of politicians and technocrats, while Jebali suggested that if he was tasked with forming a new government it would have to include non-partisan ministers and a variety of political representation that would lead to a new election. Unnamed opposition figures welcomed the resignation. The same day, Standard & Poor downgraded Tunisia's credit rating. However, the IMF said that it was still in talks for a US$1.78 billion loan to the country.\n\nAfter urging his party without success to support the interim president Moncef Marzouki in the presidential election of 2014,Eileen Byrne: Major Political Shift to Come as Tunisia Votes for New President.

He was director and editor-in-chief of Al-Fajr (Dawn), the former weekly newspaper of the Islamist Ennahda Party. Moreover, he served as longtime member of the party's executive council and remains secretary-general of Ennahda.Case Information: Hamadi Jebali, Committee on Human Rights, nationalacademies.org. Retrieved on 26 October 2011.\n\nCriminal prosecution and imprisonment\nIn June 1990, Al-Fajr published an article by Rashid al-Ghannushi called \"The people of the State or the State of the People?\" Jebali was made responsible for the publication and received a suspended sentence and a 1,500 dinars fine for the offences of \"encouraging violation of the law\" and \"calling for insurrection\". In November 1990, the Islamist newspaper contained an essay by the lawyer Mohammed Nouri, entitled \"When will military courts, serving as special courts, be abolished?\" This time, a military court sentenced Hamadi Jebali to one year in prison for \"defamation of a judicial institution\".\n\nIn May 1992 the government claimed that it had detected plans for a coup d'\u00e9tat by Ennahda, which had allegedly plotted to kill President Ben Ali and establish an Islamic state. In August 1992, Jebali, along with 170 other sympathisers of Ennahda, was charged with \"attempted overthrow\". Jebali protested that he had no knowledge of the plot's existence, and asserted that he had been tortured, presenting marks on his body for evidence. The trial was classified as unfair by observers for Human Rights Watch, the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, and Amnesty International, the latter of which named Jebali a prisoner of conscience. Eventually, on 28 August 1992 Hamadi Jebali was sentenced to a prison term of 16 years for \"membership in an illegal organisation\" and \"attempted change of the nature of the state\". The Court of Cassation confirmed the verdict.\n\nThe conditions of his imprisonment were harsh. More than ten of the 15 years that Jebali spent, were in solitary confinement. Hamadi Jebali engaged in several hunger strikes to protest against the conditions and his conviction. Two of them lasted for 36 days each. In February 2006, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Tunisia's independence, Jebali was conditionally released.\n\nPost-revolution and Prime Minister\nthumb|200px|Jebali during the WEF 2012\nFollowing the Tunisian revolution in January 2011, Ennahda was legalised. Since then, Hamadi Jebali has been present in public as the party's secretary-general and spokesman. In May 2011, he went to Washington, D.C. in the US at the invitation of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy. He also met U.S. Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman.\n\nEnsuing Ennahda's success in the Constituent Assembly election on 23 October 2011, the party nominated him as its candidate for prime minister. Jebali is considered a proponent of the reformist wing of his party.\n\nInterim President Moncef Marzouki appointed Jebali as Prime Minister of Tunisia on 14 December 2011. He presented his government on 20 December. He officially took office on 24 December.\n\nOn 19 February 2013, he resigned from his office. The move followed his attempt to form a technocratic government following the assassination of Chokri Belaid and ensuing protests against the alleged Islamisation of the country. Ennahda, however, rejected his resignation insisting on a government of politicians and Jebali formally resigned after a meeting with President Moncef Marzouki saying it was in the best interests of the country. He said: \"I promised if my initiative did not succeed I would resign as head of the government, and this is what I am doing following my meeting with the president. Today there is a great disappointment among the people and we must regain their trust and this resignation is a first step.\" Party leader Rachid Ghannouchi then suggested a government of politicians and technocrats, while Jebali suggested that if he was tasked with forming a new government it would have to include non-partisan ministers and a variety of political representation that would lead to a new election. Unnamed opposition figures welcomed the resignation. The same day, Standard & Poor downgraded Tunisia's credit rating. However, the IMF said that it was still in talks for a US$1.78 billion loan to the country.\n\nAfter urging his party without success to support the interim president Moncef Marzouki in the presidential election of 2014,Eileen Byrne: Major Political Shift to Come as Tunisia Votes for New President.

        "text": "Mark Ernest Hix  is an English chef and restaurateur whose traditional English menus often feature foraged and local foods. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hix was based in London, but announced in January 2021 that he would be relocating to Dorset permanently after five of his restaurants were put into administration.\n\nEarly life\nHix was born and raised in West Bay, Dorset. His parents divorced when he was six; while his brother Kevin went to live with their mother, their father had custody of Mark. His father was absent much of the time, so he spent a lot of time with his paternal grandfather, who was a jack of all trades: a chrysanthemum gardener, Bridport mayor, and bar owner. Hix decided to take domestic science rather than metalwork because he heard it was a good place to meet girls; to his surprise, he won a cooking award not long after. Though he considered becoming a professional golfer, he ended up attending the local Weymouth Culinary College instead.\n\nCareer\nHix moved to London from Dorset when he was 18 and his first job was in the staff canteen at the London Hilton on Park Lane. He had his first head chef position at age 22. Since then, he has worked at both The Ivy and Le Caprice, and became Caprice Holding's Chef Director in 1999. After 17 years with the company, he left in 2007 to open the successful Hix Oyster and Chop House near the Smithfield market with business partner Ratnesh Bagdai.\n\nthumb|left|Hix Oyster And Chop House in Smithfield\n\nFollowing the success of Chop House, Hix opened HIX Mayfair (previously The Abermarle), which opened inside Brown's Hotel in 2008 and closed in 2017; HIX Soho, opened in 2009 and closed in 2019; HIX Belgravia, opened in London's Hotel Belgravia in 2011 and closed the following year; and HIX City (previously Hixter City) in Devonshire Square, open 2013 to 2015. The City and Soho locations also featured a Mark's Bar. A third Mark's Bar, the first stand-alone location, opened at The Old Vic theatre in 2015 and closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHIX has also operated a number of restaurants outside his main London HIX brand. In 2005, while still working for Caprice, Hix opened The Rivington Bar and Grill, which he operated anonymously until Caprice later bought the restaurant. It closed in 2017 and was replaced by the Blacklock Shoreditch. The Tramshed, also in Shoreditch, opened in 2011 and Hixter Bankside in 2014; both closed when Hix's restaurants went into administration in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tramshed had a basement art gallery and Bankside had a Mark's Bar. Back home in Dorset, Hix opened the HIX Oyster and Fish House (2008\u20142020, 2020\u2014present) and boutique hotel the HIX Townhouse (2014\u20142020), both in Lyme Regis. He also previously operated a Champagne and caviar bar inside Selfridges on Oxford Street, which was open between 2010 and 2013, and a small pop-up cocktail bar, opened in 2013 and now closed. He and longtime friend Damien Hirst collaborated on the opening of Pharmacy 2, a revival of Hirst's Notting Hill restaurant Pharmacy (1997\u20142003), in Vauxhall next to Hirst's Newport Street Gallery. Pharmacy 2 is now closed.\n\nIn 2016, he went into business with hospitality group Westbury Street Holdings (WSH) and became a minor shareholder. In April 2020, shortly after COVID-19 shutdowns began, WSH put Hix's restaurants in administration, which closed Hix Oyster and Chop House, Bankside, Tramshed, Mark's Bar, HIX Soho, and HIX Oyster and Fish House. He claims this was done without his consent, input, or knowledge. Prior to the closures, HIX restaurants employed 130 staff members. Hix moved home to Dorset to regroup. Just two months later, Hix started the HIX Oyster and Fish Truck out of a converted Chevrolet ambulance he found on eBay for \u00a38,000. In July, he reopened the Oyster and Fish House and was hired as the Director of Food and Drink and as art curator for 1 Lombard Street's reopening. He has also purchased The Fox Inn in Corscombe from PJ Harvey's mother, a family friend, and opened the country pub in December 2020 on his 58th birthday. The inn's restaurant features local ingredients. Hix reopened Mark's Bar in Soho in October 2020.\n\nIn January 2021, he announced he would be relocating permanently to Dorset.\n\nOther ventures\nHix collaborates with alma mater Weymouth College, which named their culinary programme Hix Academy in his honour and sponsors the HIX Award, an annual art prize for emerging artists.\n\nTelevision and Publications\nHix competed in the BBC television series Great British Menu in 2007, winning the South West England heat and beating the reigning champion, Michael Caines. In doing so, two of his courses were put forward for the public vote. The main course was a crayfish and rabbit stargazy pie and, for dessert, a perry jelly with summer fruits with an elderflower ice-cream. He has also appeared on Saturday Kitchen, Food and Drink, This Morning, Global Pulse, and the minidocumentary Mark Hix on Salt.\n\nIn addition to his cookbooks, Hix has written for The Telegraph (2020\u2014present), City A.M., GQ, The Independent (2002\u20142016), and Esquire UK. In March 2021, he started hosting Soul Kitchen on Lyme Bay Radio with Neil Charlton.\n\nControversy\nPopular British television chef Keith Floyd lunched at Hix Oyster and Fish House hours before he suffered a fatal heart attack in September 2009. After Floyd's death, Hix offered a special on the menu called 'Keith Floyd's Last Lunch' which was seen by some as an appropriate tribute and was criticised by others.\n\nPersonal life\nHe and his ex Lara Cazalet have a daughter. He also has twin daughters from a previous relationship.\n\nHonours and awards\nHix was awarded an MBE in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to hospitality.\n\nCookbooks\n Eat Up: Food for Children of All Ages (, 2000)\n Simple Ways to Success: British (, 2003)\n Fish etc. The Ultimate Book for Seafood lovers (, 2004)\n British Food (, 2005)\n Simple Art of Marrying Food and Wine (with Malcolm Gluck) (, 2005)\n British Regional Food (, 2006), (, 2008)\n British Seasonal Food (, 2008), (, 2011)\n Easy Everyday British (, 2009)\n Hix Oyster & Chop House (, 2010)\n Fish Etc: The Ultimate Book for Seafood Lovers (, 2011)\n Mark Hix on Baking: Savoury & Sweet Recipes (, 2012)\n British Regional Food (, 2012)\n Valeria Napoleone's Catalogue of Exquisite Recipes (with Valeria Napoleone and Jennifer Higgie) (, 2012)\n Mark Hix: The Collection (, 2013)\n Hooked: Adventures in Angling & Eating (, 2019)\n\nExternal links\nHix Oyster and Chop House, Farringdon\nHix Oyster and Fish House, Lyme Regis\nBBC Great British Menu (featuring Mark's complete menu from the show)\n\nNotes\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:English chefs\nCategory:People from Dorset\nCategory:Reality cooking competition contestants\nCategory:Members of the Order of the British Empire\nCategory:1962 births",

        "text": "thumb|Niilo Paasivirta (2004)\n\nNiilo Paasivirta is a Finnish Internet personality, who has become known for the Internet writings that parody fundamentalist Christian views. In Finland, he's best known for the essays called \"Oikeat Mielipiteet\" (\"Correct Opinions\"), and elsewhere for the \"Love Thy Neighbor\"Love Thy Neighbor (Internet Archive) and Game of SatanGame Of Satan pages, that parody moral panic in role-playing games, as well as his Foreigner's Guide to Finland page.The Foreigner's Guide to Finland The pages were written at the time when the moral panic was being discussed, first in the mid-1990s, and the humorous approach was both disapproved of,Steve Jackson Games / Daily Illuminator, June 18, 1996,  Evil Is Afoot!

Many people have understood the joke, and supported the page for that reason, but some have thought the page was a real opinion of a \"conservative Christian\" and mocked people who had the same kind of views. It has been seen as one of the examples of Poe's law.\n\n Correct Opinions \n\nPaasivirta writes essays called \"Oikeat Mielipiteet\", or \"Correct Opinions\", to mock conservative views. Their length varies, they're typically related to current matters, and take point of view which is exaggeratedly conservative, right-wing, pro-military, patriotic and racist, in vein of the similar conservative groups in the United States. In addition to the Usenet and Paasivirta's own home page, the essays have been published on a web page called Bittivuoto.net, and a computer magazine called Enter.Niilo Paasivirta, 8.10.2007, Oikeat mielipiteet \n\n Blasphemy accusations \n\nIn 1999, Paasivirta was investigated by police for allegedly violating Finnish blasphemy laws for the material published on his web page at the end of 1998. The prosecutor noted Paasivirta had posted blasphemous material and publicly agitated others to commit such crimes, but charges were not filed because the blasphemy was no longer treated as a criminal matter.\n\nIn the material, Paasivirta briefly and without any elaboration called God a \"bull calf drone\", \"ectoplasm\", \"pickle being roasted in pig lard\", \"pedophile\", \"drug addict\" and \"career criminal\". The page also had a phone number for the police tip line and admitted to violating blasphemy laws. Later, he claimed he was referring to the invisible pink unicorn rather than the Christian God.

        "text": "Jessica Edith Louise Foster (born May 27, 1984), is a Canadian woman who disappeared in the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada, United States, in 2006. Her parents are Glendene Grant and Dwight Foster. Jessie Foster had spent some time living in Calgary, Alberta. In 2005, Foster and a friend of hers visited Florida together, and then stopped by Las Vegas on the way back in May where Foster decided to stay. Before disappearing the following year, Foster became involved in prostitution, was arrested once for solicitation, and was the victim of battery on several occasions.\n\nInvestigation\nFoster was one of four sex workers who disappeared in Las Vegas between 2003 and 2006. The bodies of the other three have been found. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department launched an investigation of a person in question, bringing in a forensic scientist to spray luminol onto surfaces at crime scenes to detect invisible blood stains; but found nothing at his property, nor has he been interrogated on her disappearance. Benjamin Perrin of Vancouver, British Columbia, received a George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature nomination for having written Invisible Chains, a book that prominently deals with human trafficking, and includes the disappearance of Jessie Foster. The documentary Trafficked No More, features her story and led to some tips to her whereabouts.\n\nOn July 26, 2015, the Calgary Sun reported police are investigating Neal Falls, a man killed on July 18, 2015, in Charleston, West Virginia, may be responsible for the four Las Vegas killings, including Foster.\n\nAftermath\nHer mother, Glendene Grant (born 1957) founded Mothers Against Trafficking in Humans following her daughter's disappearance. She hosted an internet radio show on BlogTalkRadio through Dreamcatchers for Abused Children, and has hosted such guests as Member of Parliament Joy Smith and Bobby Brown of Dog the Bounty Hunter fame. She lives in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. She had a common-law marriage with Dwight Foster, but they later separated. The last time that Grant saw her daughter was Christmas 2005. Grant Foster believes that their daughter became an unwilling victim of human trafficking, and that she thereby became a sexual slave. Grant therefore created almost a dozen websites advertising the disappearance of her daughter. In an effort to find her daughter, Grant has gotten in touch with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, bounty hunters, prostitutes, police officers, psychics, and private investigators. On the 15th Anniversary of the disappearance of Jessie Foster, Jessie's mother, Glendene Grant sat down with AU4H Radio - Real Talk hosts Donna Kshir, Lee Roberts and Laurie Ann Smith to discuss in depth Jessie's disappearance and why she believes her daughter was sold into sex trafficking. Grant told the Real Talk hosts that the investigation into Jessie's disappearance could have been handled much differently and 'she feels like the lead detective in Jessie's case.' Grant believes if proper measures had been taken by the northern Las Vegas Police Department following Jessie's disappearance there may have had a different outcome and her daughter maybe home by now.\n\nSee also\nList of people who disappeared\nProstitution in Nevada\nSex trafficking in Nevada\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1984 births\nCategory:Canada\u2013United States relations\nCategory:2000s missing person cases\nCategory:2006 in Nevada\nCategory:20th-century Canadian people\nCategory:20th-century Canadian women\nCategory:21st-century Canadian people\nCategory:21st-century Canadian women\nCategory:Canadian expatriates in the United States\nCategory:Canadian female prostitutes\nCategory:Crimes against sex workers in the United States\nCategory:Human trafficking in the United States\nCategory:Missing person cases in Nevada\nCategory:Events in Las Vegas\nCategory:Prostitution in Nevada\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:History of women in Nevada\nCategory:Violence against women in Nevada\nCategory:Women in Las Vegas",

        "text": "Eric Steven Lander (born February 3, 1957) is an American mathematician and geneticist  who is a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School. Eric Lander is founding director emeritus of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.\n\nLander served as the 11th director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Science Advisor to the President in Joe Biden's presidential Cabinet. In response to allegations that he had engaged in bullying and abusive conduct, Lander apologized and resigned from the Biden Administration effective February 18, 2022.\n\nEarly life and education\nLander was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Jewish parents, the son of Rhoda G. Lander, a social studies teacher, and Harold Lander, an attorney. He was captain of the math team at Stuyvesant High School, graduating in 1974 as valedictorian and an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist for the U.S. At age 17, he wrote a paper on quasiperfect numbers, for which he won the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.\n\nAfter graduating from Stuyvesant High School as valedictorian in 1974, Lander graduated from Princeton University in 1978 as valedictorian and with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. He completed his senior thesis, \"On the structure of projective modules\", under John Coleman Moore's supervision. He then moved to the University of Oxford where he was a Rhodes Scholar and student of Wolfson College, Oxford. He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by the University of Oxford in 1980 with a thesis on algebraic coding theory and symmetric block designs supervised by Peter Cameron.\n\nCareer\nDuring his career, Lander has worked on human genetic variation, human population history, genome evolution, non-coding RNAs, three-dimensional folding of the human genome and genome-wide association studies to discover the genes essential for biological processes using CRISPR-based editing.\n\nEarly mathematical career\nAs a mathematician, Lander studied combinatorics and applications of representation theory to coding theory. He enjoyed mathematics but did not wish to spend his life in such a \"monastic\" career. Unsure what to do next, he took a job teaching managerial economics at Harvard Business School.  At the suggestion of his brother, developmental biologist Arthur Lander, he started to look at neurobiology, saying at the time, \"because there's a lot of information in the brain\". To understand mathematical neurobiology, he felt he had to study cellular neurobiology; this, in turn, led to studying microbiology and eventually genetics. \"When I finally feel I have learned genetics, I should get back to these other problems. But I'm still trying to get the genetics right\", Lander said.\n\nLander later became acquainted with David Botstein, a geneticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Botstein was working on a way to unravel how subtle differences in complex genetic systems can become disorders such as cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia, and even obesity. The two collaborated to develop a computer algorithm to analyze the maps of genes. In 1986 Lander joined the Whitehead Institute and became an assistant professor at MIT. He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1987. In 1990, he founded the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (WICGR). The WICGR became one of the world's leading centers of genome research, and under Lander's leadership made great progress in developing new methods of analyzing mammalian genomes. It also made important breakthroughs in applying this information to the study of human genetic variation and formed the basis for the foundation of the Broad Institute\u2014a transformation Lander spearheaded.\n\nHuman Genome Project\nTwo main groups attempted to sequence the human genome. The first was the Human Genome Project, a loosely organized, publicly funded effort that intended to publish the information it obtained freely and without restrictions. Many research groups from countries all over the world were involved in this effort. The second was undertaken by Celera Genomics, which intended to patent the information obtained and charge subscriptions for use of the sequence data. Established first, the Human Genome Project moved slowly in the early phases as the Department of Energy's role was unclear and sequencing technology was in its infancy. Officially, the Human Genome Project had an eight-year head start before Celera entered the race, though discussions for the Human Genome Project began fourteen years before Celera announced their own project. Because the Human Genome Project was a $3 billion publicly funded venture, the consortia raced to enter as much of the human genome into the public domain as quickly as possible once Celera began work in 1998. This was a change of strategy for the Human Genome Project, because many scientists at the time wanted to establish a more complete copy of the genome, not simply publish the many fragments individually. Lander aggressively pressured Human Genome Project scientists to work longer and faster to publish genome fragments before Celera. Lander himself is now listed on 73 patents and patent applications related to genomics.\n\nIn February 2001, both the Human Genome Project and Celera published drafts of the human genome in the scientific journals Nature and Science, respectively. In the Human Genome Project's Nature publication, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Center for Genome Research, was listed first, with Lander listed as the first named author.\n\nLeveraging Celera's sequencing and analysis techniques, the Whitehead Institute also made a contribution to the sequencing of the mouse genome, an important step in fully understanding the molecular biology of mice, which are often used as model organisms in studies of everything from human diseases to embryonic development. The WICGR has since sequenced the genomes of Ciona savignyi (sea squirt), the pufferfish, the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, and multiple relatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the most studied yeasts. The Ciona savignyi genome provides a good system for exploring the evolutionary origins of all vertebrates. Pufferfish have smaller-sized genomes than other vertebrates; as a result, their genomes are \"mini\" models for vertebrates. The sequencing of the yeasts related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae will facilitate the identification of key gene regulatory elements, some of which may be common to all eukaryotes (including both plant and animal kingdoms).\n\nLander was the founding editor of the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics. He remained editor till 2004.\n\nAfter Human Genome Project\nLander is the founding director of the Broad Institute, a collaboration between MIT, Harvard, the Whitehead Institute, and affiliated hospitals. Its goal is \"to bring the power of genomics to bear on the understanding of disease and to accelerate the search for cures.\" In particular, Lander has discovered scientific facts in cell biology and molecular biology of cancer, as well as push precision medicine approaches. He is often credited as among the drivers for the Broad Institute's meteoric rise during the 16 years he was a director.\n\nDuring the Obama presidency, Lander cochaired the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.\n\n Toast to James Watson \nLander toasted to James Watson in 2018 for his 90th birthday, which caused controversy in the wake of Watson's widely criticized comments around intelligence and race. Lander had included a brief aside in his toast stating that Watson was flawed, but still later apologized for his toast after significant outrage from academics on Twitter. STAT News noted that other scientists had also similarly toasted Watson, but had not elicited similar outrage.\n\n CRISPR-Cas 9 Controversy \nLander received criticism in the past for allegedly diminishing the accomplishments of Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier after publishing \"The Heroes of CRISPR\" in Cell. Some argued that his article was misogynistic for having removed women scientists from history. Of particular note, Lander was accused of a conflict of interest, as the Broad Institute had been competing with UC Berkeley for patent rights to commercialize CRISPR. Lander responded by suggesting he had not meant \"to diminish anybody\" and noted that science is collaborative by nature. Criticism was particularly harsh online by other academics and biologists, due to previous resentment with Lander. During questioning for his role of Science Advisor to the President, Lander admitted that he had made a mistake in understating the accomplishments of Doudna and Charpentier.\n\nForensic science and criminal justice\n\nIn 1989, Lander provided expert testimony in the New York criminal case People v. Castro. He showed that the then-current method of interpreting DNA evidence was liable to give false positive matches, implicating innocent defendants. Two of the defense attorneys in that case, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, went on to found the Innocence Project, an organization that uses DNA analysis to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners. Lander is a member of the Innocence Project's board of directors.\n\nScience Advisor to the President\nIn 2009, Lander was appointed by President Obama as co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), serving for the entire term (2009 to 2017).\n\nalt=Lander places hand on ancient text|thumb|Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Lander as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, June 2021.\n\nIn January 2021, President-elect Joe Biden nominated Lander as Science Advisor to the President and announced that he would elevate the position to a Cabinet-level post. In January 2021, the organization \"500 Women Scientists\" published an editorial in Scientific American to consider naming someone else to the position, because he was well known within the scientific community for offending women.\nHis nomination had been held up possibly due to requests for clarification about his having attended two gatherings where Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy large-scale donor to science who was also a convicted sex offender, was present. He was also questioned about accusations of sexism and his toast to James Watson. On April 29, a confirmation hearing was held in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. On May 20, the committee voted to report favorably on the nomination, with five Republican senators voting against. On May 28, 2021, before a Memorial Day recess, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote by the full Senate. Lander was sworn in as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on June 2, 2021. He took his oath using a rare 1492 copy of the Pirkei Avot.\n\nOn February 7, 2022, Politico reported on a White House investigation in which fourteen current and former Office of Science and Technology Policy staffers accused Lander on February 4 of having bullied and demeaned his subordinates. Lander issued an apology to staff on February 4, his apology includes, \"I am devastated that I caused hurt to past and present colleagues by the way in which I have spoken to them... I believe it is not possible to continue effectively in my role, and the work of this office is far too important to be hindered.\" He later resigned on February 7. In the following month, Politico published an analysis of Lander's connections with Eric Schmidt. Politico documented the appearance of conflicts of interest related to Schmidt's financial support for many of the employees of the OSTP.\n\n After resignation \nSince 2023, Eric Lander has returned to his tenured professor positions at MIT and Harvard as well as the Broad Institute as a Core Institute Member and Founding Director Emeritus. While some opinion pieces argued that \"Eric Lander is getting uncanceled\", The Chronicles of Higher Education noted that some staffers at the Broad expressed alarm at Lander's sudden return without further discussion from their leadership. In 2023, Lander started a non-profit called Science for America focused on \"moonshot\" ideas such as nuclear fusion or cancer research.\n\nRecognition and service\nIn 1999, Lander received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\n\nIn 2004, Lander was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of our time for his work on the Human Genome Project. He has appeared in numerous PBS documentaries about genetics. He was ranked #2 on the MIT150 list of MIT's innovators and ideas.\n\nIn December 2008, Lander and Harold E.

        "text": "Malachy Bernard Loye (born 27 September 1972), is an English former cricketer who played first-class cricket for Northamptonshire, Lancashire, and England A. Loye is a right-handed batsman, particularly well known for his slog sweep shot against fast bowlers. Deep into a long career, he also finally made his One Day International debut against Australia on 19 January 2007 aged 34 years 113 days.\n\nEarly life\nLoye was educated at Moulton Comprehensive School and Durham University, where he played for the university side. He was part of the Durham University team that won the 1993 Universities Athletic Union final against Manchester University.\n\nCareer\n\nNorthamptonshire\nAfter making his debut in 1991, Loye received the Northamptonshire cap in 1994, and passed 1,000 runs in a season for the first time in 1996. In 1998 he made almost 1,200 first-class runs including the county's individual scoring record of 322 not out against Glamorgan. In the same game he shared a stand of 401 with David Ripley which beat the record of the highest fifth-wicket stand in England, a record which in turn lasted until a stand by Colin Ackermann and Wiaan Mulder in July 2022. Loye ended up with four hundreds in 1998, a new season best, and was named PCA Player of the Year to follow on from his 1993 award of PCA Young Player of the Year. After a couple of lean years where he made less than 600 runs, Loye has averaged above 48 in every season save 2002, and scored more than 900 runs a season. Now he has over 10,000 first-class runs to his name and has represented both England U19 and England 'A', first touring South Africa with England 'A' in 1993-4, and returning in 1998-9.\n\nLancashire\nLoye transferred to Lancashire in 2003. He was an ever-present during Lancashire's march to the County Championship Division Two title in 2005 and was the county's leading run-scorer with 1,198, including a knock of 200 against Durham. He almost became the first Lancashire batsman ever to score consecutive double centuries but was dismissed for 194 in the next match against Essex. Loye also made a century in the Twenty20 Cup for the first time when he hammered exactly 100 against Durham, including five sixes and 10 fours. Loye became a mainstay in the Lancashire top-order from there on and his good form provided him with a call-up to England's One Day International 30-man preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy in India. He was awarded with a benefit season for 2008.England legends line up for Loye  Lancashire County Cricket Club Website\n\nReturn to Northamptonshire\nAfter 7 years away from Northamptonshire, Loye returned to Wantage Road, signing a 2-year contract on 29 September 2009.Mal Loye is a Steelback  Northants Cricket Website. Retrieved 30 September 2009. He was released by the county following the 2011 season. Following his release he joined Buckinghamshire for the 2012 season, making his debut for the county in the MCCA Knockout Trophy against Dorset.\n\nInternational career\nOn 4 October 2006 he was called up to the England squad for the Hong Kong Sixes event in November. Loye acted as a wicket keeper for the England team led by Dominic Cork during the tournament.\n\nIn January 2007 Loye was playing for Auckland, when he was called up to the England squad as cover for the injured Michael Vaughan,Vaughan out of Brisbane one-dayer BBC Sport and made his One Day International debut on 19 January 2007 when he was England's top scorer with 36 runs off 36 balls.Commonwealth Bank Series BBC Sport Cricket commentator Simon Mann remarked after the game that \"Loye's front foot sweep for six off Brett Lee was the stroke of the series so far\".England spirit shakes Aussies BBC Sport\n\nLoye was left out of England's squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup in favour of Ravi Bopara. Chairman of selectors David Graveney said that Loye could be considered unlucky and had not done anything wrong, but that his inclusion would have made the squad \"top-heavy\". He was also left out of England's Twenty20 squad for a tournament in South Africa, despite having had healthy stats and success in the domestic form of the game over the previous few seasons and having averaged 57 in the 2007 tournament. \nBopara wins place ahead of Loye Cricinfo.

She was United States Ambassador to Senegal concurrently accredited to Guinea-Bissau from April 2006 to June 2007.\n\nBiography\n\nPersonal\nJanice L. Jacobs was educated at Southern Illinois University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in French in 1968.  She later received a Master of Arts in National Security Strategy from the National War College in 1995. Her husband, Ken Friedman, works for the Department of Defense. Jacobs spent many years overseas as a dependent of her father who was an education officer with USAID and of her first husband, Royce Fichte, a Foreign Service Officer.\n\nCareer\nJacobs joined the United States Foreign Service in March 1980.  In her career as a Foreign Service Officer, she was posted in Senegal, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia (twice), France, Mexico (twice), Nigeria, and Thailand.  She also spent time posted to the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C., in the State Department's Visa Office, Operations Center, and Office of Cuban Affairs.  In 2000, she became Deputy Chief of Mission of the United States Embassy in Santo Domingo.  In October 2002, she moved to Washington, D.C. to become Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services.\n\nIn February 2006, President of the United States George W. Bush named Jacobs United States Ambassador to Senegal and United States Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau.  She presented her credentials on May 9, 2006, and formally left Dakar on July 15, 2007. President Bush nominated Jacobs as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs and she was sworn into this office on June 10, 2008. She retired from the position in 2014.\n\nIn September 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry appointed Jacobs to the newly created position of \"Transparency Coordinator.\" This position was created to coordinate the State Department response to the myriad of document requests related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email scandal. This appointment caused minor controversy after it was reported that Jacobs had donated to Hillary for America in June 2015. Jacobs contributed $2,700, which is the maximum allowed by law, to Clinton's campaign on June 22, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nState Department Biography\n\nCategory:Ambassadors of the United States to Senegal\nCategory:Ambassadors of the United States to Guinea-Bissau\nCategory:United States Assistant Secretaries of State\nCategory:Southern Illinois University alumni\nCategory:1946 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:United States Foreign Service personnel\nCategory:American women ambassadors\nCategory:21st-century American diplomats\nCategory:21st-century American women",

During 1986 and 1987, Kong recorded for several of Jamaica's top producers, including Prince Jammy, with whom he enjoyed his biggest hits with \"Trouble Again\" (the title track from his Jammy-produced debut album proper) and \"Legal We Legal\",Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd ed., Rough Guides, , p. 300 Black Scorpio, Harry J, Errol Thompson, Ossie Hibbert, Bunny Lee, and Prince Jazzbo. While many of his songs were typical in content of the era, several of his songs had political and cultural themes.Foster, Chuck (1999) Roots Rock Reggae: an Oral History of Reggae Music from Ska to Dancehall, Billboard Books, , p. 158 He released several albums during this period before relocating first to New York, and then to Canada in the late 1980s, where he released material occasionally on his Conscious Music label. The death of Tenor Saw in 1988 prompted King Kong to release \"He Was a Friend\" as a tribute, and in 1989 he relocated to England and recorded with Mafia & Fluxy and Gussie P in the early 1990s. He began recording more regularly again in the 2000s.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nTrouble Again (10 November 1986), Greensleeves\nTwo Big Bull Inna One Pen (1986), Firehouse \u2013 with Anthony Red Rose\nLegal We Legal (1986), Jammy's \u2013 issued in the UK as Trouble Again on Greensleeves Records, reissued (2008), Greensleeves with bonus tracks\nDancehall Session (1986), Striker Lee\nMusical Confrontation (1986), Jammy's \u2013 with Nitty Gritty\nBig Heavy Load (1987), Striker Lee\nIdentify Me (1987), Black Solidarity\nMusical Terrorist (198?), Our Land Sound Productions\nRumble Jumble Life (2005), Massive B\nEthiopian Dream (2012), (King Shiloh)\n\nSingles\n\"You Pack up and gone\" (1986), Jammy's\n\"Can\u00b4t Ride Computer\" (1986), Jammy's \u2013 Riddim : Tempo\n\"Pink Eye\" (1982), 56 Hope Road\n\"Sensimania Is Walking\" (1985), R:E:M\n\"Ninja\" (1985), Sunset\n\"AIDS\" (1986), Firehouse\n\"Babylon\" (1986), Firehouse\n\"Trouble Again\" (1986), Greensleeves/Jammy's\n\"Mix Up\" (1986)\n\"Legal We Legal\" (1986), Greensleeves\n\"Paro Them Paro\" (1986), Greensleeves\n\"Have Some Approach\" (198?), Black Solidarity\n\"Niceness\" (1986), Black Scorpio\n\"Identify Me\" (198?), Black Scorpio\n\"Rich & Switch\" (1986), Java\n\"Rip and Run Off\" (1986), Big M\n\"Nice Christmas\" (198?), Firehouse\n\"Step on My Corn\" (198?), Firehouse\n\"No Call Me No Boops\" (198?), Firehouse\n\"Don't Touch My Boops\" (1986), Jammy's\n\"Big Boy\" (1986), Oneness\n\"Rocky Road\" (1986), Fresh Roses\n\"Good Fi Nuttin\" (198?), Firehouse\n\"Girls Dem A Come\" (198?), Ujama\n\"Raggamuffin A Pass\" (1986), Ujama\n\"Can't Distress Me\" (198?), Parish\n\"Toots Boops\" (1987)\n\"Eden a Come\" (1987), Black Scorpio\n\"Can't Tan It\" (1987), Sunset\n\"Musical Terrorist\" (1987), Sunset\n\"Time Is The Master\" (1987), Upsetter Music\n\"Reggae Mylitis\" (198?), Sunset\n\"No Touch De Gorilla\" (1987)\n\"Over Cover Lover\" (198?), Live & Love\n\"Dollars Strong\" (198?), MCM\n\"Highest Grade\" (198?), Black Scorpio\n\"Ragamuffin A Pass\" (198?), Now Generation\n\"Predominent\" (198?), Now Generation\n\"Du No Get High\" (198?), Ottey's\n\"Song of Love\" (198?), Pisces\n\"Don't Trouble Trouble\" (198?), Striker Lee\n\"Glamour Boy in Mi Life\" (198?), Striker Lee\n\"Must Work On Sunday\" (198?), Striker Lee\n\"Moving On African Border\" (198?), Striker Lee\n\"Four Year Old\" (198?), Apple Tree\n\"Job\" (198?), Apple Tree\n\"Here I Am\" (19??), Bugu B\n\"Agony And Pain\" (198?), Jah Life Time\n\"He Was a Friend\" (1988), Conscious Music\n\"Magic Moment\" (1989), Taurus\n\"Identify Me\" (19??), Digikal\n\"Digital We Digital\" (19??), Digikal\n\"Break Down The Walls\" (????), Jammy's\n\"Jah Jah Rule\" (19??), Thompson Sound\n\"Who Say\" (19??), Thompson Sound\n\"Dem A Fake\" (????), Jammy's\n\"Imagine\" (????), Jammy's\n\"Seize All Guns\" (????), Jammy's\n\"Try Not I\" (19??)\n\"Once Upon A Time\" (198?), King Kong \u2013 with Leroy Mafia\n\"Progress\" (198?), Thunderbolt\n\"Not A Bwoy Caan Test We\" (1991), Gussie P\n\"Trouble Again Pt. 2\" (199?), Jammy's\n\"Unity Medley\" (19??), Massive Sounds \u2013 with Anthony B and Burro Banton\n\"Unfortunate Children\" (????), Ffrench\n\"Have A Little Sound\" (????), Sinbad\n\"Bag Juice & Cheese Chips\" (199?), Massive B\n\"Call Mr. Madden\" (1995), Massive B\n\"Earth Is The Lord\" (????), Massive B\n\"Ethiopia\" (????), Massive B\n\"Free Speech\" (????), Massive B\n\"Legalize It\" (????), Massive B\n\"Troubles\" (????), Massive B\n\"Unity\" (????), Massive B\n\"Seem Dem There\" (????), Reggae Explorer\n\"My Darling\" (1998), Jammy's\n\"Works of Jah\" (2001), Roots Foundation\n\"Jah Is My Best Friend\" (2002), Massive B\n\"Big Money Pay\" (200?), Badd\n\"Big Bad Sound\" (200?), Sweet Beat\n\"Paradise Lost\" (2004), Massive B\n\"Higher High\" (2004), Conscious Music\n\"African Border\" (2005), Flash\n\"Rumble Jumble Life\" (2005), Massive B\n\"Free De Herb\" (2005), Inkalink\n\"1922\" (2005), Rashanco\n\"Who Say\" (2005), Thompson Sound\n\"I Feel A Joy\" (2005), Massive B\n\"Evolution\" (2006), Jahspora\n\"Dem Nah Do Nuttun\" (2006), Run Things\n\"This Train\" (2006), Diop Side\n\"Jah is the Ruler\" (200?), Koogah Sound\n\"Flirt\" (2008), Phantom\n\"Not A Bwoy Caan Test We\" (2008), Sip a Cup\n\"Mi Ave A Likkle Sound\" (2008), Sip a Cup\n\"Missin Africa\" (2009), Massive B\n\"Chosen One\" (2009), Uplift \u2013 B-side of Lutan Fyah's \"Babylon a Fiss\"\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Musicians from Kingston, Jamaica\nCategory:Jamaican reggae singers\nCategory:1962 births\nCategory:Greensleeves Records artists\nCategory:Firehouse 12 Records artists",

        "text": "Donita Sparks (born April 8, 1963) is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter most notable for being the co-founder of the band L7.  Sparks also initiated, performed, and released original material with her solo project, the band Donita Sparks and the Stellar Moments.\n\n Early life \nSparks was born on April 8, 1963, in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.  One of several sisters, Sparks was raised in Oak Lawn, in a family that regularly participated in political actions. Sparks credits her father for cultivating her sense of rhythm at an early age and her mother with instilling an awareness of equal rights. During high school, Sparks used her older sister's ID to get into clubs, including Club 950 Lucky Number and Neo. Following her graduation from high school in 1981, she attended classes at the Community Film Workshop of Chicago. Sparks worked for a year as a foot messenger for a photo lab, delivering photos in downtown Chicago, prior to moving to Los Angeles at the age of 19.\n\n Career \nSparks met Suzi Gardner in 1984 and they formed the creative foundation of L7 by 1985. Sparks and Gardner had both worked at LA Weekly, although at separate times, and were active participants in the Art punk DIY scene in the Echo Park/Silver Lake area when they began writing music together. Sparks credited mutual friends at LA Weekly for connecting her to Gardner and stated that the publisher was a cultural hub of performance artists, writers, and musicians including Vaginal Davis and Jonathan Gold on staff at the time.\n\nRecognized for subverting and transcending the expectations of performers in the late 80s and early 90s, L7 produced seven original studio albums between 1985 and 2019. In a 1993 article for Spin which featured L7 on the magazine's cover, Ren\u00e9e Crist described L7 as \"four of the funniest, meanest, strongest, coolest, most pissed-off women I know\" and as \"wild, rambunctious, spontaneous\" with a stage show that \"is a wash of buddy love, crowd working, and acrobatics\".\n\nIn 1994, Sparks appeared in the John Waters film Serial Mom as a musician and performer in the fictitious band \"Camel Lips.\"\n\nSparks released her debut solo record Transmiticate as Donita Sparks and the Stellar Moments in February 2008.  The Boston Globe, in a June 2008 review, described Sparks performance as high energy with a commanding stage presence.\n\nIn 2008, Sparks and Kristin Hersh co-founded CASH Music (Coalition of Artists and Stakeholders) as a means to self release their own music; the non-profit organization has grown to offer marketing and publishing tools for musicians that are open source.\n\nSparks's music has been featured in the films Natural Born Killers, Brokeback Mountain, Perks of Being a Wildflower and in the video games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Rock Band 2.\n\nShe is also the drummer for the tribute band, Lou Man Group, a performance homage to Lou Reed and the Blue Man Group.\n\nL7 reformed in 2014 and embarked on a reunion tour in 2015. The documentary L7: Pretend We're Dead, directed by Sarah Price, features original footage and interviews with Donita Sparks and was released November 2016. The film was nominated for a VO5 NME Award for Best Music Film.\n\nSparks continues to perform live shows with the original line up of L7 and co-wrote two new songs with Suzi Gardner: Dispatch from Mar-a-Lago, 2017 and I Came Back to Bitch, 2018 that were released as singles.\n\nL7's latest full album Scatter the Rats was released on Blackheart Records on May 3, 2019.  Sparks gave a number of interviews reflecting on the trajectory of the group and discussing the challenges and triumphs faced over the years by the band. The band resumed a six-week national tour starting on May 10, 2019.\n\nSparks guitar of choice is the deliberately angular Flying V which she described as looking like \"something from the Jetsons.\"\n\nIn March 2019, Sparks appeared as part a panel discussion along with Henry Rollins, Marky Ramone, and John Lydon following a screening for the Epix docuseries Punk. While the conversation became heated between Lydon and Ramone, Sparks maintained her composure and humor, crediting both the Sex Pistols and the Ramones as sources of inspiration in her youth.\n\nIn November 2019, Sparks participated in a digital full life interview for the Women of Rock Oral History Project housed at the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College. In the interview, Sparks discusses her early life and career with L7 as well as her experiences as a woman in the music industry. \n\nRolling Stone magazine announced that Sparks was hosting a new show called The Hi-Low Show With Donita Sparks that began streaming every Friday starting in April 2020. The weekly show has been structured to feature performances by Sparks and special musical guests.\n\n Philanthropy \nSparks and L7 formed Rock for Choice with the Feminist Majority Foundation in 1991, staging numerous concerts benefiting pro-choice organizations featuring some of the biggest bands in the industry including Nirvana and Hole.\n\nNotable stage moments\nalt=Donita Sparks playing to the crowd|thumb|Sparks onstage with the reformed L7 in 2018\nWhile L7 was performing at the Reading Festival in 1992, their speakers blew out. The crowd became restless and relentlessly threw mud onto the stage, pelting the band. In response, Sparks reached into her pants and threw her tampon back at the crowd, and said \"Eat my used tampon, fuckers!\" The tampon became known as one of the \"most unsanitary pieces of rock memorabilia in history\".\n\nLater in 1992, Sparks dropped her pants, appearing bottomless, on live television during an L7 performance on the UK variety show The Word. Of the incident, Sparks later commented that the particular show L7 appeared on already had questionable aspects underway including \"a men's bum contest\" and a \"hidden camera in Oliver Reed's dressing room, showing him intoxicated with his shirt off, which was really fucked up. So I added my contribution to this craziness.\"\n\nDiscography\n\nL7\nYearTitleLabelNotes1988L7Epitaph RecordsDebut album1990Smell the MagicSub PopReissued in 1991 with three extra songs1992Bricks Are HeavySlash RecordsReached No. 1 on Billboard Heatseekers1994Hungry for StinkSlash RecordsReached No. 2 on Billboard Heatseekers1997The Beauty Process: Triple PlatinumSlash RecordsFirst album without bassist Jennifer Finch1998Live: Omaha to OsakaMan's Ruin RecordsLive album1999Slap-HappyWax Tadpole RecordsStudio album2000The Slash YearsSlash RecordsCompilation of popular songs from 1992 to 19972016Fast and Frightening Easy Action RecordsDouble album of rarities, covers, and live tracks2017Detroit: LiveEasy Action RecordsRecorded live at Clutch Cargo's in Detroit 19902019Scatter the RatsBlackheart RecordsFull album, original lineup \n\nViggo Mortensen's Spoken Word\nYearTitleLabelNotes1999One Man's MeatTDRS Music\n\nDonita Sparks and the Stellar Moments\nYearTitleLabelNotes2008Transmiticate    CASH MusicDebut album\n\nReferences\n\n External links \n\nNyrock.com interview\n2016 Donita Sparks Interview \u2013 Australian Rock Show Podcast\nLou Man Group website\n\nCategory:1963 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:American punk rock bass guitarists\nCategory:American rock bass guitarists\nCategory:American women guitarists\nCategory:American women singer-songwriters\nCategory:American rock singers\nCategory:American feminist musicians\nCategory:American abortion-rights activists\nCategory:American atheists\nCategory:American rock songwriters\nCategory:American women bass guitarists\nCategory:American women punk rock singers\nCategory:American punk rock guitarists\nCategory:Riot grrrl musicians\nCategory:L7 (band) members\nCategory:Singers from Chicago\nCategory:Guitarists from Chicago\nCategory:20th-century atheists\nCategory:21st-century atheists\nCategory:20th-century American bass guitarists\nCategory:20th-century American women musicians\nCategory:Musicians from Los Angeles\nCategory:Singer-songwriters from Illinois\nCategory:Singer-songwriters from California\nCategory:Women in punk",

        "text": "Air Vice Marshal Steven Peter \"Zed\" Roberton,  (born  1968) is a retired senior commander of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He joined the RAAF in 1989 and trained as a fighter pilot. He has deployed to  Iraq, commanded No. 75 Squadron RAAF (2003\u201306) and No. 82 Wing RAAF (2010\u201311), and led Air Task Group 630 on operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (2014\u201315). He served as commander Air Combat Group RAAF from 2015 to 2017, Air Commander Australia from 2017 to 2019, and Head Force Design within the Vice Chief of Defence Force Group from June 2019 to February 2022.\n\nEarly life\nRoberton grew up on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, where he was an active surfer. He studied a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Mathematics at the University of Queensland, graduating in 1988. He had originally intended to pursue graduate studies in medicine, but after joining the university glider club he gained a passion for flying and decided to embark on a career in aviation.\n\nRAAF career\nRoberton was accepted into the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a direct entry pilot trainee in 1989. He completed initial officer and flight training at RAAF Point Cook and RAAF Base Pearce, graduating from No. 153 Pilots Course in 1990. He specialised as a fighter pilot, training on the Macchi MB-326, before converting to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet in 1993. A three-year fighter tour with No. 3 Squadron RAAF followed at RAAF Base Williamtown, before he was posted on exchange with the United States Marine Corps at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina from 1996. He returned to No. 3 Squadron, as commander of A Flight, in 1998.\n\nRoberton was posted to the Fighter Requirements division of the Capability Development Group for eighteen months from July 2000. He was then selected to attend the Australian Command and Staff College, where he graduated with a Master of Management in Defence Studies from the affiliated University of Canberra in 2002. Following the course, he was appointed Deputy Director Aircraft Survivability within the Capability Development Group and deployed in support of Operations Slipper and Falconer, Australia's contribution to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Roberton received a Chief of Air Force Commendation for his performance in the Middle East and, following his return to Australia, assumed command of No. 75 Squadron RAAF at RAAF Base Tindal from November 2003.\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.35|Roberton led the RAAF's transition from the F-111C (left) to the F/A-18F (right) from 2006 to 2010.\nTowards the end of his three years of squadron command, Roberton thought he may have reached his ceiling in the RAAF and was again contemplating studies in medicine at the University of Queensland. He was instead head-hunted to lead the RAAF's A$6.5 billion transition from the General Dynamics F-111C to the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet, serving as Head Air Combat Transition Office from November 2006. Roberton was posted to RAAF Base Amberley in command of No. 82 Wing RAAF in April 2010, having overseen the introduction of the Super Hornet into Australian service ahead of schedule and below budget. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2012 Australia Day Honours, the award recognising his \"exceptional capability, capacity and devotion\" to \"effective Air Combat Group capability\" in both his command appointments and during the introduction of the Super Hornet. Roberton next completed the Higher Command and Staff Course in the United Kingdom in early 2012, before returning to Australia in April as Director General Aerospace Development in the Capability Development Group.\n\nIn September 2014, Roberton was selected as the inaugural commander of Air Task Group 630 on Operation Okra. The air task group deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Consisting of 400 RAAF personnel and eight aircraft, it was the largest air task group to deploy from Australia since the Vietnam War. Under Roberton's command, Air Task Group 630 conducted airstrikes, flew in support of Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces, and assisted in freeing Yezidi people trapped in the Sinjar Mountains. Roberton handed over command of the air task group to Air Commodore Glen Braz on 5 January 2015, by which time the Australian aircraft were flying approximately 13 percent of coalition airstrikes in Iraq. In recognition of his \"tireless devotion and exceptional personal skills\" in the establishment, deployment and initial operations of Air Task Group 630, Roberton was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in the 2016 Australia Day Honours.\n\nRoberton was appointed commander Air Combat Group at RAAF Base Williamtown in January 2015, with responsibility for the administration of the RAAF's fast-jet combat aircraft and command of Australia's air combat operations. Following promotion to air vice marshal, he succeeded Air Vice Marshal Gavin Turnbull as Air Commander Australia\u2014responsible for the operational capability of the RAAF\u2014on 1 May 2017. Roberton became Head Force Design within the Vice Chief of Defence Force Group in June 2019.\n\nPersonal life\nRoberton is married to Libby, with whom he has three children. He has logged more than 3,500 hours flying fighter aircraft, mostly in the F/A-18.\n\nReferences\n\n|-\n\nCategory:1968 births\nCategory:Australian aviators\nCategory:Australian military personnel of the Iraq War\nCategory:Australian military personnel of the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Members of the Order of Australia\nCategory:People from the Sunshine Coast, Queensland\nCategory:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (Australia)\nCategory:Royal Australian Air Force air marshals\nCategory:University of Canberra alumni\nCategory:University of Queensland alumni",

He has deployed to  Iraq, commanded No. 75 Squadron RAAF (2003\u201306) and No. 82 Wing RAAF (2010\u201311), and led Air Task Group 630 on operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (2014\u201315). He served as commander Air Combat Group RAAF from 2015 to 2017, Air Commander Australia from 2017 to 2019, and Head Force Design within the Vice Chief of Defence Force Group from June 2019 to February 2022.\n\nEarly life\nRoberton grew up on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, where he was an active surfer. He studied a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Mathematics at the University of Queensland, graduating in 1988. He had originally intended to pursue graduate studies in medicine, but after joining the university glider club he gained a passion for flying and decided to embark on a career in aviation.\n\nRAAF career\nRoberton was accepted into the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a direct entry pilot trainee in 1989. He completed initial officer and flight training at RAAF Point Cook and RAAF Base Pearce, graduating from No. 153 Pilots Course in 1990. He specialised as a fighter pilot, training on the Macchi MB-326, before converting to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet in 1993. A three-year fighter tour with No. 3 Squadron RAAF followed at RAAF Base Williamtown, before he was posted on exchange with the United States Marine Corps at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina from 1996. He returned to No. 3 Squadron, as commander of A Flight, in 1998.\n\nRoberton was posted to the Fighter Requirements division of the Capability Development Group for eighteen months from July 2000. He was then selected to attend the Australian Command and Staff College, where he graduated with a Master of Management in Defence Studies from the affiliated University of Canberra in 2002. Following the course, he was appointed Deputy Director Aircraft Survivability within the Capability Development Group and deployed in support of Operations Slipper and Falconer, Australia's contribution to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Roberton received a Chief of Air Force Commendation for his performance in the Middle East and, following his return to Australia, assumed command of No. 75 Squadron RAAF at RAAF Base Tindal from November 2003.\n\nthumb|left|upright=1.35|Roberton led the RAAF's transition from the F-111C (left) to the F/A-18F (right) from 2006 to 2010.\nTowards the end of his three years of squadron command, Roberton thought he may have reached his ceiling in the RAAF and was again contemplating studies in medicine at the University of Queensland. He was instead head-hunted to lead the RAAF's A$6.5 billion transition from the General Dynamics F-111C to the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet, serving as Head Air Combat Transition Office from November 2006. Roberton was posted to RAAF Base Amberley in command of No. 82 Wing RAAF in April 2010, having overseen the introduction of the Super Hornet into Australian service ahead of schedule and below budget. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2012 Australia Day Honours, the award recognising his \"exceptional capability, capacity and devotion\" to \"effective Air Combat Group capability\" in both his command appointments and during the introduction of the Super Hornet. Roberton next completed the Higher Command and Staff Course in the United Kingdom in early 2012, before returning to Australia in April as Director General Aerospace Development in the Capability Development Group.\n\nIn September 2014, Roberton was selected as the inaugural commander of Air Task Group 630 on Operation Okra. The air task group deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Consisting of 400 RAAF personnel and eight aircraft, it was the largest air task group to deploy from Australia since the Vietnam War. Under Roberton's command, Air Task Group 630 conducted airstrikes, flew in support of Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces, and assisted in freeing Yezidi people trapped in the Sinjar Mountains. Roberton handed over command of the air task group to Air Commodore Glen Braz on 5 January 2015, by which time the Australian aircraft were flying approximately 13 percent of coalition airstrikes in Iraq. In recognition of his \"tireless devotion and exceptional personal skills\" in the establishment, deployment and initial operations of Air Task Group 630, Roberton was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in the 2016 Australia Day Honours.\n\nRoberton was appointed commander Air Combat Group at RAAF Base Williamtown in January 2015, with responsibility for the administration of the RAAF's fast-jet combat aircraft and command of Australia's air combat operations. Following promotion to air vice marshal, he succeeded Air Vice Marshal Gavin Turnbull as Air Commander Australia\u2014responsible for the operational capability of the RAAF\u2014on 1 May 2017. Roberton became Head Force Design within the Vice Chief of Defence Force Group in June 2019.\n\nPersonal life\nRoberton is married to Libby, with whom he has three children. He has logged more than 3,500 hours flying fighter aircraft, mostly in the F/A-18.\n\nReferences\n\n|-\n\nCategory:1968 births\nCategory:Australian aviators\nCategory:Australian military personnel of the Iraq War\nCategory:Australian military personnel of the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Members of the Order of Australia\nCategory:People from the Sunshine Coast, Queensland\nCategory:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (Australia)\nCategory:Royal Australian Air Force air marshals\nCategory:University of Canberra alumni\nCategory:University of Queensland alumni",

        "text": "Ivan Peter Fellegi, OC (Hungarian: Fellegi P\u00e9ter Iv\u00e1n; born June 22, 1935) is a Hungarian-Canadian statistician and researcher who was the Chief Statistician of Canada from 1985 to 2008.\n\nFormer President of the International Statistical Institute, Honorary Member of the Statistical Society of Canada and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society among other associations, Dr. Fellegi has authored or co-authored extensive academic and research papers about various aspects of statistics, probability, mathematics, the social and economic implications of statistics, and the successful management of statistical organizations. An invaluable expert in his field and an exemplary public servant who has dedicated his career to serving the Canadian public, Fellegi has been honored with numerous awards and accolades, including six honorary doctorates, the Order of Canada, the Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic, Career Achievement Award of the Canadian Policy Research Initiative, and the Outstanding Achievement Award of the Public Service of Canada. Since 2008, he has been the Chief Statistician Emeritus at Statistics Canada, where he continues to maintain an office today.\n\n Early life \nBorn in Szeged, Hungary, Fellegi was working his way to complete mathematical studies at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University when the Hungarian Uprising was crushed in 1956. When Fellegi was 21 years old, his mother arranged for a sympathetic physician to label her son a tuberculosis patient so that he could travel to the border area near Austria, ostensibly to receive treatment. Unfortunately, the pre-arranged smugglers were unavailable but several local teenagers, aided by a local woodcutter, agreed to lead him and his cousin to safety away from the Russian patrols. The pair trekked the mountains through cover of darkness until they made it to safety at the Austrian border. Shortly thereafter, Fellegi arrived in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to join his elder sister and soon began working for Statistics Canada (then known as the Dominion Bureau of Statistics).\n\nIn 1957, Fellegi completed his studies with night courses at Carleton University, in spite of being a new refugee without access to his Bachelor of Science transcripts. In 1958, he became the first Carleton University student to receive a Master of Science degree. Upon completing his doctoral studies in mathematical statistics in 1961, he became Carleton's first Ph.D. graduate. As there was no curriculum for his program at the time, his studies were largely self-guided.\n\nWhile mathematical statistics became his lifeblood, Fellegi\u2019s first love was literature and poetry. At the age of 14, he became the youngest member of the Hungarian Writers\u2019 Association. He changed the trajectory of his studies when he was about to take entrance exams for university. Counter to his professors\u2019 recommendations, he decided that mathematics was factual and far less open to interpretation than literature, so in 1953, he opted to take the mathematics entrance exam and placed in the top five scores nationally.\n\n Career \nIn 1957, Fellegi was hired as a statistician at Statistics Canada, despite having not yet mastered English or French or being a Canadian citizen. In 1962, Fellegi was appointed Director of Sampling Research and Consultation Section, and in 1965, he was appointed Director of Sampling Research and Consultation Staff, before becoming Director General of the Methodology and Systems Branch in 1971. He was promoted to Assistant Chief Statistician in 1973 and became Deputy Chief Statistician in 1984.\n\nWhile at Statistics Canada, two of Fellegi\u2019s research papers, \u201cA Theory for Record Linkage\u201d (1969) and \u201cA Systematic Approach to Automatic Edit and Imputation\u201d (1973), earned the distinction of becoming 2 of the 19 landmark papers in survey sampling published between 1934 and 1990.\n\nAs an Assistant Chief Statistician, he took leave without pay in 1978 to work for the United States Commission on the Reorganization of the US Statistical System as established by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nOn September 1, 1985, with close to 30 years experience, Fellegi was appointed Chief Statistician of Canada. Statistics Canada is widely regarded as one of the best statistical agencies in the world and, under his leadership, received that recognition in 1991 and again in 1993 from The Economist magazine. Fellegi announced his retirement as Chief Statistician on February 15, 2008, after 23 years at the helm of the agency. He continues to serve Canada voluntarily as the Chief Statistician Emeritus.\n\nFellegi served as the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Carleton University from 1995 to 1997.\n\nInternationally, he chaired the Conference of European Statisticians of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe from 1993 to 1997 and was the inaugural chairman of the Statistics Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As such, he played a key role in coordinating the (overlapping) mandates of the OECD Statistics Committee and the Conference of European Statisticians. At different periods of his career, he served as President of the International Statistical Institute, the International Association of Survey Statisticians, and the Statistical Society of Canada. He contributed to a number of international statistical projects, including work on the United States Census through the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nFellegi provided advice on statistical matters to his native Hungary following its transition to democracy, and in 2004 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary. He was also asked to review the statistical systems of Switzerland and Portugal.\n\nFellegi has been recognized in Canada and around the world for his extensive contributions to the field of statistics and public service. In 1965, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. In 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was later promoted to Officer in 1998. He is an Honorary Member of the International Statistical Institute and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, a Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nHe has been awarded the Gold Medal of the Statistical Society of Canada (1997), the Robert Schuman Medal by the European Community (1997), La M\u00e9daille de la ville de Paris (1999), the Outstanding Achievement Award of the Public Service of Canada (2002), the Office of the Commission of Official Languages Leadership Award (2002), the Career Achievement Award of the Canadian Policy Research Initiative (2002), the Outstanding Career Award from the Public Service of Canada (2017), and the Outstanding Service Award of Statistics Canada (2017).\n\nAs Chief Statistician Emeritus of Canada, Fellegi continues to lend his expertise and provide invaluable advice and guidance to Statistics Canada staff. He attributes much of his success to the love and support of his family, including his wife of many years, Marika Fellegi, and their two daughters, both of whom have gone on to become successful medical professionals in their own right.\n\n Titles and memberships \n\n Honorary Fellow, Royal Statistical Society\n Fellow, American Statistical Association\n Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\n Vice-President, International Statistical Institute (1977-1981)\n President, Statistical Society of Canada (1982)\n President, International Association of Survey Statisticians (1985-1987)\n President Elect, International Statistical Institute (1985-1987)\n President, International Statistical Institute (1987-1989)\n Member, Board of Governors, Carleton University (1989-1992)\n Honorary Member, International Statistical Institute (1993)\n Chair, Conference of European Statisticians for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (1993-1997)\n Chair, Board of Governors, Carleton University (1995-1997)\n Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (2004)\n Honorary Member, Statistical Society of Canada (2008)\n\n Honorary doctorates \n\n Honorary Doctorate of Law, Simon Fraser University (1995)\n Honorary Doctorate of Law, McMaster University (1997)\n Honorary Doctorate of Science, Carleton University (1999)\n Honorary Doctorate, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (2001)\n Honorary Doctorate, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (2002)\n Honorary Doctorate, University of Ottawa (2008)\n\n Selected publications \n\n \"The Organisation of Statistical Methodology and Methodological Research in National Statistical Offices.\" Survey Methodology 36, no. 2 (2010).\n \"The Effectiveness of a Supranational Statistical Office: Pluses, Minuses, and Challenges Viewed from the Outside.\" Journal of Official Statistics 21, no. 2 (2005).

She was elected as a Labour Party MP in the 2017 United Kingdom general election for the constituency of Peterborough and was removed from that office in 2019 following a successfully recall petition triggered by her conviction of perverting the course of justice.\n\nOnasanya was found guilty on 19 December 2018 for lying to police to avoid being prosecuted for speeding. She unsuccessfully sought to secure permission to appeal against the conviction. Her expulsion from the Labour Party, effective in December 2018, was announced in January 2019. On 29 January 2019 she was sentenced to three months in prison. She was removed from office on 1 May 2019 after a successful recall petition, automatically triggered in cases of a custodial sentence of a year or less, under the Recall of MPs Act 2015. This prompted a by-election, making her the first MP to lose their seat through the recall process.\n\nEarly life and career\nOnasanya was born in Cambridge and is of Nigerian ancestry. Her parents, Frank and Paulina Onasanya, separated when she was three and she lived with her mother and younger brother. Onasanya was educated at Netherhall School and studied law at the University of Hertfordshire and the University of Law. She worked at the solicitors Nockolds, then Eversheds. Following her admission as a solicitor in November 2015, she worked at Howes Percival, then DC Law, specialising in commercial property law.\n\nOnasanya was elected as Labour Cambridgeshire County Councillor for King's Hedges in Cambridge in 2013 and became deputy leader of the Labour group on the council. She was also the local party's spokeswoman for children and young people and sat on the council's Joint Consultative Committee for teachers. In 2017 she unsuccessfully sought the nomination to be Labour's candidate for Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.\n\nOnasanya moved to Peterborough in 2014.\n\nParliamentary career\nFor the 2017 general election, Onasanya was selected by the Labour Party to stand in the constituency of Peterborough, which had been held since 2005 by Stewart Jackson, a Conservative. Onasanya defeated Jackson with a majority of 607 votes and a 2.7% swing to Labour. In July 2017, she said that she wished to be Britain's first black prime minister.\n\nOnasanya was appointed as a Labour whip and as a parliamentary private secretary to Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith. She attracted some notice when she quoted lyrics from Man's Not Hot, a viral song, during a budget debate in November 2017. She voted remain in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum and subsequently voiced support for a second vote on Brexit, either by means of a second referendum or a general election.\n\nAfter being found guilty of perverting the course of justice, it was announced in January 2019 that she had been expelled from the Labour Party in December 2018.\n\nOn 12 March 2019, Onasanya voted against the Government's Brexit withdrawal agreement, which was defeated in the second \"meaningful vote\". This was reported to be her first vote in the House of Commons since her release from prison and the first occasion that an MP voted while wearing an electronic tag. On 4 April, Onasanya voted to legally require the Prime Minister to seek an extension of Article 50 from the European Union. The bill passed by just one vote and Onasanya's critical role was highlighted by the media.\n\nOn 27 March 2019, Onasanya was among the 21 MPs who voted against improved LGBT education in schools.\n\nIn late April, Onasanya made her only speech in the Commons during the period between her release from prison and losing her seat as a result of the successful recall petition. During her two-minute intervention, she disputed the government's assertion that austerity was coming to an end.\n\nCriminal conviction and removal from office\nIn July 2018, Onasanya was charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to two speeding incidents which occurred in 2017. The first charge alleged that she was driving the vehicle during a speeding incident on 24 July 2017 but that, with her brother Festus Onasanya, she had claimed that someone else was driving. The second charge concerned a speeding incident on 23 August 2017 when Festus is alleged to have been the one driving. Her brother was charged with three counts, two relating to the same incidents as his sister. She appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 12 July 2018. Onasanya said on 27 July 2018 that she \"strongly refutes any suggestions that I have broken the law\". On 13 August 2018 at the Old Bailey, she pleaded not guilty to the one charge against her, relating to an alleged offence in Thorney, Cambridgeshire, in July 2017. Her trial date was set for 12 November 2018.\n\nA week before he was due to face trial with his sister, Festus Onasanya admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice. At the first trial, Onasanya said she did not know who was driving on 24 July 2017. She said that she initially mistakenly assumed that she could not have been driving the car on 24 July 2017 due to political commitments and left a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) to be dealt with by whoever had been driving. Her brother, she said, had probably returned the form claiming someone else had been driving. She said she now realised that she had had an appointment that would be consistent with her having been the driver but could not remember whether she had kept the appointment. On 26 November 2018, the jury was discharged as it was unable to reach a verdict.\n\n Conviction and appeal \nAt a retrial in December 2018, she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Following the verdict, she was immediately suspended from the Labour Party, which also called on her to resign as an MP. She was expelled from the party the following day. Her local newspaper, the Peterborough Telegraph, also called on her to resign.\n\nOnasanya continued to protest her innocence, saying in a message to other Labour MPs that she was \"in good biblical company along with Joseph, Moses, Daniel and his three Hebrew friends who were each found guilty by the courts of their day\", and that \"Christ ... was accused and convicted by the courts of his day and yet this was not his end but rather the beginning of the next chapter in his story\". A week later, she indicated that she would not resign her seat. She applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal against the conviction.\n\nthumb|Fiona Onasanya (right) leaving the Royal Courts of Justice after her application to appeal was rejected\nOn 29 January 2019, Onasanya was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and her brother was sentenced to ten months. As she received a custodial sentence, but of less than 12 months, a recall petition would be started after the appeal process had concluded. The local Labour Party said it would \"actively\" campaign in favour of such a petition. (A custodial sentence of more than a year, including a suspended one, would have led to her being removed as an MP automatically, in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1981.) In a statement on 31 January, the Attorney General's Office said it had received a request for the case to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, but on 25 February, it concluded that the sentence was not unduly lenient. Onasanya was released on home detention curfew from HM Prison Bronzefield in Surrey on 26 February. Her ability fully to participate in Parliamentary business depended on the terms of her curfew.\n\nOn 5 March 2019, her application for permission to appeal against the conviction was refused by the Court of Appeal. Onasanya presented without legal counsel, legal binders or notes, and the court found \"absolutely no basis\" for challenging the conviction.\n\n Recall \n\nLater the same day, 5 March, the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, duly informed the House that he gave notice under Section 1 of the Recall of MPs Act 2015 that the opening of a recall petition against Onasanya may be organised; if more than 10% of the Peterborough electorate were to sign such a petition within six weeks, then her seat in the House of Commons would become forfeit and a by-election would be triggered, though she would be free to stand in that by-election.\n\nThe recall petition was called on 19 March and was available for signature until 1 May 2019. On the day prior to the recall petition being called, Onasanya released a video protesting her innocence. On 1 May, it was announced that the recall petition had exceeded the necessary threshold of  10% of the electors in her seat: 19,261, or 27.6%, had signed. As a result, her seat was declared vacant, causing a by-election in Peterborough. The Electoral Commission later disclosed that 28% of eligible voters had signed the petition, with the threshold of 10% being reached in the first two days.\n\nOn 3 May, Onasanya announced that she would not stand in the by-election. The previous Labour candidate, Lisa Forbes, stood again for the party, winning the by-election.\n\n Removal as a solicitor \nIn August 2019 a disciplinary tribunal of the Solicitors Regulation Authority struck Onasanya from the roll of solicitors and ordered her to pay costs of \u00a36,562, after finding that she had \"failed to act with integrity\", had not \"(upheld) the rule of law and proper administration of justice\" and had \"acted dishonestly\".\n\nPersonal life\nOnasanya lives in Paston, Peterborough, and attends iCAN Community Church in East London. She is a member of Christians on the Left (formerly the Christian Socialist Movement). It has been claimed that her religious beliefs partly stem from being involved in a road traffic collision as a child, when, although Onasanya was badly injured, her mother took her home and prayed rather than taking her to hospital.\n\nShe is a patron of Women Worldwide Advocating Freedom and Equality and was a trustee of East Hertfordshire YMCA, which closed in June 2018.\n\nOnasanya stated during her trial, in November 2018, that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In 2020 she self-published a memoir, Snakes & Adders.\n\nIn June 2020, Onasanya attracted national and international attention by accusing Kellogg's of racism for using a monkey as the mascot of their Coco Pops cereal.\n\nSee also\n\nChris Davies \u2013 former MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, the second MP to have faced a recall petition under the terms of the Recall of MPs Act 2015, and who was defeated in the subsequent by-election held in August 2019.\nChris Huhne \u2013 resigned as a Member of Parliament in 2013 when he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice over a speeding case in 2003, in relation to the matter of who was driving.\n\n References \n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:1983 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:21st-century English criminals\nCategory:21st-century British women politicians\nCategory:Alumni of the University of Hertfordshire\nCategory:Alumni of the University of Law\nCategory:Black British MPs\nCategory:Black British women politicians\nCategory:English female criminals\nCategory:British people convicted of perverting the course of justice\nCategory:British politicians convicted of crimes\nCategory:Councillors in Cambridgeshire\nCategory:English people of Nigerian descent\nCategory:English solicitors\nCategory:English politicians convicted of crimes\nCategory:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies\nCategory:Independent members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom\nCategory:Labour Party (UK) councillors\nCategory:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nCategory:People educated at Netherhall School\nCategory:Politicians from Cambridge\nCategory:People with multiple sclerosis\nCategory:Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales\nCategory:UK MPs 2017\u20132019\nCategory:Women councillors in England\nCategory:British lawyers with disabilities\nCategory:British politicians with disabilities",
