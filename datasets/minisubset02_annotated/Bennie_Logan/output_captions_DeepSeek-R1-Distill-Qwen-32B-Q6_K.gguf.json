        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Bennie Logan is present in the image described by the caption. Let's start by looking at the Wikipedia excerpt. It says he was born on December 28, 1989, and played for the Philadelphia Eagles, among other teams. The image caption mentions \"Logan pursues Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III in 2013.\" \n\nHmm, the caption explicitly names Logan and describes him in action during a specific year, 2013. Since the name matches exactly, that's a strong indicator that he's in the image. Also, the year is given, so I can calculate his age. \n\nTo find his age in 2013, subtract his birth year from 2013: 2013 - 1989 equals 24 years old. \n\nNow, considering the probability guidelines, since the caption explicitly states his presence, the probability should be high. The example given for explicit name match was 0.9 to 1.0. I think 0.98 is appropriate here because it's a direct mention and a specific year, making it very likely he's in the image.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the explanation would mention the explicit name match and the calculation of his age. The probability is high, and the age is 24.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Bennie Logan pursuing Robert Griffin III in 2013.
