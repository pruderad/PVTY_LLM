        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a Wikipedia excerpt about Ognyan Velikov Nikolov and an image caption. My task is to determine if Nikolov is present in the image, estimate his age based on the information, and provide a structured JSON response with an explanation.\n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt carefully. It mentions that Nikolov was born on 13 June 1949. He's a retired Bulgarian freestyle wrestler who won a silver medal at the 1972 Olympics. So, his birth year is 1949, and he was active in the 1970s.\n\nNext, I'll look at the image caption: \"Nikolov (left) at the 1972 Olympics.\" This explicitly states that Nikolov is in the image, specifically on the left side. The event is the 1972 Olympics, which matches the information from the Wikipedia excerpt.\n\nNow, to determine the probability of his presence. Since the caption directly mentions his name and places him at the 1972 Olympics, this is a clear and explicit mention. According to the guidelines, explicit name matches should have a high probability, typically between 0.9 and 1.0. Given that it's a direct mention without any ambiguity, I'll assign a probability of 0.98.\n\nMoving on to estimating his age. The image is from the 1972 Olympics. Nikolov was born in 1949, so subtracting 1949 from 1972 gives us 23 years old. Therefore, his estimated age in the image is 23.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should state that the caption explicitly mentions Nikolov's presence, and using his birth year and the event year, his age is calculated. The JSON structure will include the explanation, the probability, and the age.\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted with the right keys and values. The explanation should be concise but clear, and the age should be a number since it's calculable.\n\nSo, the final JSON should look like this: an explanation stating Nikolov is explicitly in the image, a high probability, and his age calculated as 23.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Nikolov is in the image. He was born in 1949, and the image is from 1972, making him approximately 23 years old.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 23"
