        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Michigami is present in the image described by the caption \"Michigami in 2017.\" First, I'll look at the Wikipedia excerpt provided. It mentions Michigami as a Japanese racing driver with a lot of experience in various racing series. The excerpt also includes his racing records and other details about his career.\n\nNow, the image caption is \"Michigami in 2017.\" This seems pretty straightforward because the caption explicitly states that Michigami is in the image. There's no mention of a portrait or statue, so it's likely a photo of him from that year.\n\nNext, I need to determine his age in 2017. The Wikipedia excerpt doesn't provide his exact date of birth, but it does mention that he was born in 1973. Wait, actually, looking again, the categories at the end of the excerpt include \"Category:1973 births,\" which indicates he was born in 1973. So, subtracting 1973 from 2017 gives his age as 44.\n\nFor the probability, since the caption explicitly mentions Michigami, it falls under the explicit name match category. The guidelines suggest a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. Since the caption clearly states his presence, I'll assign a high probability, maybe 0.98.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation would be that the caption explicitly shows Michigami, born in 1973, so in 2017 he was 44 years old. The probability is high because his name is clearly mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Michigami is in the image from 2017.
