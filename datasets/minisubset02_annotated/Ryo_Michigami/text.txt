is a Japanese racing driver. He last drove a Honda NSX GT3 Evo for Yogibo Drago Corse in Super GT in the 2021 Super GT Season. He won the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship in 2000.

He competed in the GT500 category of the Super GT series in 1995 and then from 1998 to 2013. He drove for Mugen from 1998 to 2002, for Dome from 2003 to 2009, and for Nakajima Racing from 2010 to 2013. Apart from 1995, he always drove for Honda teams, and became Honda's first champion in the series in 2000. He also won the Suzuka 1000 km three times; in 1999, 2003 and 2004.

After his initial retirement, he formed the Drago Corse team, which competed in Super GT's GT500 class in 2015 and 2016 before withdrawing from the series. Michigami and the Drago Corse team would return to Super GT in 2018, albeit competing in the GT300 class with the NSX GT3. This marked Michigami's return as a full-time competitor, and his first season as a driver-owner in the series. Drago Corse also competed in All-Japan Formula Three Championship as the ThreeBond Racing team.

In 2017, Michigami drove a factory Honda Civic in the World Touring Car Championship. He became the first Japanese driver in the series to finish on the podium at the Race of Macau.
