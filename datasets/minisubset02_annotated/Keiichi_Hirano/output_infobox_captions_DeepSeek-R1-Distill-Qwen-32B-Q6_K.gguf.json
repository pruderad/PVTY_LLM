        "generated_response": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether Keiichi Hirano is present in the image described by the caption. The Wikipedia excerpt says he played for the Orix Buffaloes from 2002 to 2007 and again from 2013 to 2015. So, he was definitely part of that team during those years. \n\nThe image caption is \"Hirano with the Orix Buffaloes.\" The name \"Hirano\" is explicitly mentioned, and it's in the context of him being with the team. That makes me think the probability is high. \n\nNow, for the age estimation. The Wikipedia says he was born on April 7, 1979. The image caption doesn't mention a specific year, but since it's about his time with the Orix Buffaloes, I can infer the years based on when he was with the team. \n\nLet's pick a middle year, say 2010, which falls within his second stint with the Buffaloes (2013-2015). Wait, 2010 is actually between his two stints. Hmm, maybe I should choose a year closer to when he was active. Let's take 2014 as an example. \n\nSubtracting his birth year from 2014: 2014 - 1979 = 35 years old. \n\nSo, the explanation would be that the caption explicitly states Hirano is with the Orix Buffaloes, giving a high probability, and estimating his age based on his playing years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Keiichi Hirano with the Orix Buffaloes, indicating his presence. Born in 1979, if the image is from 2014, he would be 35 years old.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 35"
