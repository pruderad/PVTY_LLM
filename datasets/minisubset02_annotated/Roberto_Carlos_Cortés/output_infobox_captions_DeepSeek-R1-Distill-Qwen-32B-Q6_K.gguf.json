        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to figure out whether Roberto Carlos Cortés is present in the image based on the given Wikipedia excerpt and image caption. Let me start by reading the Wikipedia excerpt carefully.\n\nFrom the excerpt, I gather that Roberto Carlos Cortés Restrepo is a Colombian former footballer born on 20 June 1977. He played as a defender for Independiente Medellín and had a successful career, including winning the Categoría Primera A in 2002-II and the Copa América in 2001. He also played for the Colombia national team between 1999 and 2003.\n\nNow, looking at the image caption: it simply says \"Roberto Carlos Cortés.\" The caption doesn't provide any additional context, such as a location, event, or other people in the image. It's just his name.\n\nI need to determine the probability that he's present in the image. According to the guidelines, if the caption explicitly states the person's name, it's an explicit name match, which falls under the 0.9-1.0 probability range. However, sometimes captions can be misleading or refer to portraits, statues, or other representations.\n\nIn this case, the caption is very straightforward—it just mentions his name without any other details. Since it's only his name, it's a bit ambiguous. It could be a direct image of him, but it could also be a portrait or a statue. Without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that if the caption refers to a portrait, statue, or object depicting the person, the probability should be low, around 0.0-0.3. But here, the caption doesn't specify that it's a portrait or statue; it just states his name. So maybe it's a direct image.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes names are used in captions without the image showing the person. For example, if it's a team photo, the caption might list all the players' names, but the image might not focus on any one individual.\n\nBut in this case, the caption is only his name, which is more suggestive of him being the main subject of the image. However, without more context, I can't be 100% sure. So, perhaps a high probability but not the maximum.\n\nLooking at the guidelines again, explicit name match is 0.9-1.0. But since there's no additional context, maybe it's a bit lower. Maybe around 0.95?\n\nWait, the example given for explicit name match was a caption that included other details, like \"Churchill and his fiancée...\". In that case, the probability was 0.98. Here, the caption is just the name, which is less detailed but still explicit.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to assign a high probability, maybe 0.95, because the name is explicitly mentioned, but without additional context, it's slightly less certain.\n\nNext, estimating his age. The Wikipedia excerpt states he was born on 20 June 1977. The image caption doesn't provide a specific year. So, I need to see if I can infer the year from any other information in the caption or excerpt.\n\nThe image caption is just his name, so there's no year mentioned. The Wikipedia excerpt mentions his career up to 2003, but that doesn't help because the image could be from any time. Since there's no year given, I can't calculate his age. Therefore, the estimated age should be \"unknown.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation would be that the caption explicitly states his name, so he's likely present, but without a year, his age can't be determined. The probability is high, around 0.95, and the age is unknown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Roberto Carlos Cortés, suggesting his presence in the image. However, without a specific year, his age cannot be estimated.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.95,\n    \"estimated_age\": \"unknown\""
