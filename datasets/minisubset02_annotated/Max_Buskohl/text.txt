Biography

Early life
Buskohl lives with his mother and sister in Berlin. Buskohl was part of a band called Empty Trash with his friend Stefan, who was the guitarist, and Julius, who played bass. Max's father is Carl Carlton. Buskohl lived in a boarding school in Ireland until 2006.

DSDS
Buskohl finished 4th in season 4. Buskohl auditioned for DSDS because he lost a bet. Max decided to leave the show after failing in an attempt to get his band, Empty Trash, included in the recording contract if he had won. Viewers had wondered about judge Dieter Bohlen's uncharacteristic behaviour when he gave an extremely critical review of Buskohl's performance on 21 April 2007. Buskohl is alleged to have said that Bohlen was asocial, which explains Bohlen's negative reaction. However, RTL stated that "We have made it clear that we are not looking for super-band, but a superstar". Buskohl decided to leave the show the Thursday prior to Top 4. Buskohl stated in an interview with Der Spiegel that he left DSDS voluntarily while RTL claims they threw out Buskohl. Bohlen claims that Max tried to "extort record company and the station". Buskohl participated in the Top 4 at RTL's request. Dieter Bohlen stated that "You may not give a shit what I say, so I do not give a damn what you're singing" during the Top 4. Martin Stosch, who was originally eliminated, replaced Buskohl in the show.  Buskohl was considered a heartthrob on the show with his "super-slim" body and being  tall.
