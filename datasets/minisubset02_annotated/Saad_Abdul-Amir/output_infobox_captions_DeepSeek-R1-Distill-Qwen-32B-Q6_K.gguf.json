        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Saad is in the image based on the Wikipedia excerpt and the image caption. Let me start by reading the Wikipedia excerpt to get his details.\n\nFrom the excerpt, Saad was born on 19 January 1992. He's an Iraqi footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder. He's been part of several clubs and the national team. Importantly, he was selected for the 2016 Summer Olympics as one of the over-23 players. He was the captain in all three games and scored Iraq's only goal in the final group game against South Africa.\n\nNow, looking at the image caption: \"Saad with Iraq at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\" The caption explicitly mentions Saad and his participation in the Olympics. Since the caption clearly states his presence in the image, I can assign a high probability, probably around 0.98.\n\nNext, I need to estimate his age. The image is from 2016. Saad was born in 1992, so subtracting 1992 from 2016 gives us 24 years old. Therefore, his estimated age is 24.\n\nI should make sure there's no ambiguity. The caption doesn't refer to a portrait or statue; it's a direct mention of him at the Olympics. So, the presence is confirmed, and the age can be calculated accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Saad is present with the Iraq team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.
