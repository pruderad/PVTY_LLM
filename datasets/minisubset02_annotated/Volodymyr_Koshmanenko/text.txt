Koshmanenko is a notable Ukrainian mathematician and a talented researcher. Koshmanenko has been reading lectures at Taras Shevchenko University, National Pedagogical Dragomanov University and National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. He has over 120 publications and 5 monographs. Volodymyr Koshmanenko promotes creativity in science, incredible performance, healthy lifestyle.

 Biography 

In 1960, he entered the Department of Physics at Dnipropetrovsk State University and graduated from it in 1966. He attended the lectures of the mathematical content mainly from the third year of study. This led him to choice of the mathematical style of thinking.

During his post-graduate courses, 1967–1970, he studied the axiomatic approach in quantum field theory. He showed that any
Boson scalar quantum field admits the representation and the axiomatic formulation in terms of operator Jacobi matrixes. It was the main result of his PhD thesis (1970) (the scientific advisor was Yu. M. Berezansky).

From 1970 up to now he occupied different scientific positions, from junior to leading researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv. In 1985, he got the Doctor degree in mathematics for the theses "The scattering theory in terms of bilinear functionals" with M.S. Birman, I.Ya. Arefieva, and M.I. Portenko as the main referees.

In 1993, he held the position of Professor of the Department of Higher Mathematics of the Dragomanov National Pedagogical University of Kyiv.

 Research area 

The research interests of V. Koshmanenko concern the modeling of complex dynamical systems, fractal geometry, functional analysis, operator theory, mathematical physics. He proposed the construction of wave and scattering operators in a pair of spaces in terms of bilinear functionals, introduced a notion of singular quadratic form and produced  the classification of pure singular quadratic  forms in  scales of Hilbert spaces, developed the self-ad joint extensions approach to the singular perturbation theory in scales of Hilbert spaces, investigated the direct and inverse negative eigenvalues problem under singular perturbations.

V. Koshmanenko proposed the original theory of conflict dynamical systems  and built a series new models of complex dynamical systems with repulsive and attractive interaction. He proved the theorem of conflict in terms of probability measures, showed the possibility in fractal setting to reconstruct the lost physical type spectrum under interaction with a source of purely singular (spirit) continuous spectrum. He  introduced a notion of the structural similarity measures and proposed a series  models of complex dynamical system with conflict interaction which are named: conflict triad, fire-water model, conflict society, where the  fixed points (equilibrium states) and  the limiting cyclic orbits    are investigated.
