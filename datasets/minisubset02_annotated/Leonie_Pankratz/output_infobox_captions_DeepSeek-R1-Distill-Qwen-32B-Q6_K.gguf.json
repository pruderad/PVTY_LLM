        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to determine if Leonie Pankratz is present in the image described by the caption and estimate her age if possible.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the Wikipedia excerpt. It mentions that Leonie Pankratz was born on 25 January 1990, so her birth year is 1990. She's a German footballer who plays as a defender for HJK Helsinki. The excerpt also details her international career, honours, and personal life, including her education and various clubs she's played for.\n\nNext, the image caption is: \"Pankratz in the Hoffenheim jersey in 2014.\" The name \"Pankratz\" matches the subject from the Wikipedia excerpt, which is Leonie Pankratz. The caption explicitly states that she is wearing the Hoffenheim jersey in 2014, which directly refers to her presence in the image.\n\nNow, regarding the probability of her being present, since the caption explicitly mentions her name and the jersey she's wearing, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category. According to the guidelines, this should result in a high probability, likely between 0.9 and 1.0. Given the direct mention, I'll assign a probability of 0.98.\n\nFor the age estimation, the image is from 2014. Leonie was born in 1990, so subtracting 1990 from 2014 gives her age as 24 years old in that year. Therefore, the estimated age is 24.\n\nI should structure the JSON output with the explanation, the probability, and the age. The explanation should clearly state that the caption explicitly mentions her presence and the year, allowing for the age calculation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Leonie Pankratz is in the image wearing the Hoffenheim jersey in 2014. She was born in 1990, making her 24 years old in 2014.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 24"
