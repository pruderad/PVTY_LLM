Leader of opposition in Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council and Telugu Desam Party politburo member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu criticised the governor for meeting AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh in New Delhi in October 2013. "Why should the governor go to Digvijay's residence and brief him? Is it part of governor's official duties?", Yanamala questioned.
