        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether Emma Raducanu is present in the image described by the given caption and estimate her age if possible.\n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt to extract her name and date of birth. The excerpt mentions that Emma Raducanu was born on November 13, 2002. So, her birth year is 2002.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"Raducanu at the [[2025 Australian Open]]\". The caption explicitly states that Emma Raducanu is present at the 2025 Australian Open. This is a direct mention of her name in the context of the image, which strongly suggests her presence.\n\nNow, I need to determine the subject present probability. Since the caption explicitly mentions her name and the event, I can assign a high probability. According to the guidelines, explicit name matches should have a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. I'll choose 0.98 to reflect a high confidence level.\n\nFor the age estimation, the image is from 2025. Subtracting her birth year (2002) from 2025 gives her age as 23 years old.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention that the caption explicitly states her presence and calculates her age based on the event year and her birth year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Emma Raducanu is present at the 2025 Australian Open.
