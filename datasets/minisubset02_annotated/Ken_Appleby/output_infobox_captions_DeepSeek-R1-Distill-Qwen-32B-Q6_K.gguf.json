        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. I'm supposed to determine if the person described in the Wikipedia excerpt is present in the image based on the caption, estimate their age if possible, and provide a structured JSON response with an explanation, the probability of their presence, and their estimated age.\n\nLooking at the input, the Wikipedia excerpt is about Ken Appleby. He was born on April 10, 1995, and has a career in ice hockey. The image caption is \"Appleby with the Manitoba Moose in 2019.\"\n\nFirst, I'll extract the necessary information from the Wikipedia excerpt. Ken Appleby's name is clearly stated, and his date of birth is April 10, 1995. So, his birth year is 1995.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption. The caption explicitly mentions \"Appleby with the Manitoba Moose in 2019.\" This directly states that Ken Appleby is in the image. Since the caption explicitly names him and mentions the team and the year, this falls under the category of an explicit name match, which according to the guidelines, should have a high probability (0.9 - 1.0). I'll assign a probability of 0.98 as in the example.\n\nNow, for the age estimation. The caption mentions the year 2019. Ken Appleby was born in 1995, so subtracting 1995 from 2019 gives us 24 years old. However, since his birthday is on April 10, if the image was taken before April 10, 2019, he would still be 23. But the caption doesn't specify the exact date, just the year. Therefore, it's safe to estimate his age as 24 in 2019.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should state that the caption explicitly mentions Ken Appleby with the Manitoba Moose in 2019, making his presence certain. His age is estimated by subtracting his birth year from 2019, resulting in 24.\n\nI should structure the JSON response with the explanation, the high probability, and the estimated age. Also, I need to ensure that the JSON is valid and follows the specified format without any markdown or additional text.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Ken Appleby is with the Manitoba Moose in 2019. He was born in 1995, making him 24 years old in 2019.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 24"
