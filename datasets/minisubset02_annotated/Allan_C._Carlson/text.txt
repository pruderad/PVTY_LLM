Biography
Carlson earned his B. A. from Augustana College and his Ph.D. in European History from Ohio University in 1975. He served as a member of the Lutheran Council in America's Government Affairs Office from 1975 to 1978. In 1979, he became a lecturer and assistant-to-the-president at Gettysburg College. He joined The Rockford Institute in 1981 (becoming its President in 1986). In 1997, he joined with John A. Howard in splitting off from that organization and forming the Howard Center. He was appointed to the National Commission on Children in 1988 by Ronald Reagan. In 2003, Carlson served on the ISI summer faculty at Oriel College, Oxford. He is Senior Editor of Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity.

His articles and treatises have addressed the underlying causes of population decline, the effects of taxation and regulation on the size and well-being of the family, as well as historical efforts to implement a family wage in the United States. He has observed that the post-World War II baby boom in the United States was largely a "Catholic phenomenon".Carlson, Allan. "Why Things Went Wrong: The Decline of the Natural Family" . Speech given at the Pope John Center, Dallas, TX, January 31 – February 4, 1994. "[T]he 1945–1964 era produced a 'heroic' flowering of Catholic family life in America. Although fertility rose for all American religious groups, it rose far more rapidly and stayed high longer among Catholics.... The total marital fertility rate for non-Catholics averaged 3.15 children born per woman in the early 1950s and 3.14 in the early 1960s. For Catholics, the respective figures were 3.54 and 4.25."Carlson, Allan. "The Family Factors", Touchstone, January/February, 2006

Carlson has also criticized the impact of feminism on women's roles in society as disastrous and continuing to take its toll on the family.
