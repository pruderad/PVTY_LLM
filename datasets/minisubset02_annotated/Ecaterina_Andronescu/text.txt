Biography

Background and first ministerial position
She was born in Malovăț, Mehedinți County and became an engineer in 1972 upon graduation from the Oxidic Materials Science and Engineering department of the Politehnica University of Bucharest's Industrial Chemistry Faculty. In 1982, she earned a doctorate in the same field, and pursued further studies in Western Europe in the 1990s. From 1972 to 1983, she was an assistant lecturer at Politehnica, then lecturer from 1983 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994 she was a reader there, and she has been a professor at the same institution since 1994. From 1989 to 1992, she was assistant dean of the Industrial Chemistry Faculty, and dean from 1992 to 2004. She became the university's rector in 2004, serving until 2012.

In 1996, Andronescu joined the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR; PSD since 2001). She had been a secretary of state at the Education Ministry since the preceding year, and at the autumn 1996 elections (which the PDSR lost), she gained a seat in the Chamber and left the ministry. Until 2000, she was secretary of its committee on education, science and youth, continuing as a member until 2008. 2000-2004 Profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site ; accessed 19 September 2009 2004-2008 Profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site ; accessed 19 September 2009 Re-elected in 2000, she was appointed to the incoming Năstase cabinet, serving until 2003, when Alexandru Athanasiu replaced her. 

As minister, she took a number of controversial decisions, including the reintroduction of a required examination for entering university faculties; changing of the modality of admission to high schools; and a change in the method for correcting the baccalaureate. Critics charged that these "experiments" had introduced "anachronism and chaos" into the Romanian educational system, perturbing both pupils and teachers, "Tineretul PD solicită 6% din PIB pentru Școală" ("PD Youth Seeks 6% of GDP for Schools") , Ziua, 20 June 2003; accessed 20 September 2009 and Andronescu's reputed inability to justify and sustain her decisions earned her the nickname of Abramburica (a coined term mixing abracadabra and brambura, "aimless").

Opposition and return to government
She was again elected to the Chamber in 2004, and to the Senate in 2008. Election results , alegeri.tv; accessed 19 September 2009 During the latter campaign, she charged the incumbent National Liberal Party (PNL) government with immorality, corruption and incompetence regarding education, and touted her 2001–2003 efforts to introduce computers into classrooms and build gyms; these two programmes were themselves criticised at the end of 2004, after the PSD had been voted out of office, for the computerisation effort's weak results and for both having been undertaken after no-bid contracts worth tens of millions of dollars.

Following her election to the Senate, where she served on the culture committee until 2010, also becoming vice president of the education committee in 2009, 2008-2012 Profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site ; accessed 19 September 2009 she was named Education Minister once again. "Guvern de regățeni, cu 'moț' ardelean" ("Old Kingdom Government, with a Few Transylvanians") , Adevărul, 19 December 2008; accessed 19 September 2009 During this cabinet stint, Andronescu again attracted controversy. In May 2009, the authors of the nationwide high school admission test made two errors when writing the questions, prompting the resignation of two Education Ministry employees, "Ministerul Educaţiei a acceptat demisia persoanelor responsabile de gafa din teza unică la Istorie" ("Education Ministry Accepts Resignation of Persons Involved in History Test Gaffe"), Realitatea TV, 22 May 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 and contributing to worries among PSD leaders that Andronescu was damaging their party's image. She later indicated a willingness to scrap the test in its current form, citing unpopularity among teachers. "Andronescu: Toată lumea din teritoriu este împotriva tezelor unice" ("Andronescu: the Whole Country Is against the Single Thesis"), Mediafax, 24 August 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 That July, she announced her ministry would no longer issue diplomas for the private Spiru Haret University (and might seek its outright closure), claiming that institution had failed to undergo accreditation and authorisation for its offerings. Raul Florea, "Universităţile 'Spiru Haret' şi 'Petre Andrei' au fost scoase în afara legii. 56.000 de absolvenţi, în aer.

Guvernul are dreptul să facă recurs" ("Spiru Haret University Wins First Suit against the Government, Which May Appeal"), Gândul, 14 August 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 

She worked on pushing a new educational code through Parliament, but the PSD's former government partner, the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), has its own proposals; despite her expressed wish, the debate became entangled in the autumn presidential campaign, where the parties are supporting rival candidates. Eugenia Mihalcea, "Guvernul, rupt în două de legile educaţiei" ("Government Split in Two by Education Laws") , Jurnalul Naţional, 19 August 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 Monica Iordache Apostol, "Sparge Educația buba Coaliției?" ("Will Education Break the Coalition?") , Jurnalul Național, 20 August 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 In September, Prime Minister Boc threatened Andronescu with dismissal if she did not annul an order allowing the Education Minister (as opposed to school inspectors) the power to change school directors; she countered that this would decrease the politicisation of the process, while Geoană commented that Boc alone could not dismiss her without consulting his party. Eugenia Mihalcea, "Ecaterina Andronescu, amenințată de Boc" ("Ecaterina Andronescu, Threatened by Boc") , Jurnalul Național, 19 September 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 Boc's move followed rising discontent with her within the PDL, whose members Ioan Oltean and Radu Berceanu suggested that Andronescu herself was trying to politicise the educational process. Izabela Niculescu, "Ecaterina Andronescu – Oltean îi cere demisia, Berceanu îi bate obrazul" ("Ecaterina Andronescu – Oltean Asks for Her Resignation, Berceanu Slaps Her Cheek"), Cotidianul, 4 September 2009; accessed 20 September 2009 The PDL also suggested that Andronescu's proposals aimed at sabotaging Boc's own reform project, which the party claimed was addressing the fundamental issues. Together with her PSD colleagues, Andronescu resigned from the cabinet on 1 October 2009, in protest at the dismissal of vice prime minister and Interior Minister Dan Nica. "Miniștrii PSD şi-au depus demisiile la cabinetul premierului Emil Boc" ("PSD Ministers Submit Their Resignations in the Office of Prime Minister Emil Boc"), Mediafax, 1 October 2009; accessed 1 October 2009 Boc himself took over her ministry, on an interim basis.

Plagiarism controversy and subsequent developments
In July 2012, Andronescu became Education Minister a third time, appointed by Prime Minister Ponta. When President Traian Băsescu signed off on her appointment, he requested that she confirm she had not plagiarized her doctoral thesis. This came amid a backdrop of plagiarism scandals that, among other effects, had forced her predecessor Ioan Mang to resign. Andronescu, although finding the request "demeaning" for her professional career, declared she had never committed plagiarism. Sebastian Zachmann, "Ecaterina Andronescu, noul ministru al Educaţiei" ("Ecaterina Andronescu, New Education Minister"), Adevărul, 2 July 2012; accessed 2 July 2012 Thomas Dinca, "Ecaterina Andronescu la Educaţie, propunerea lui Ponta" ("Ecaterina Andronescu for Education, Ponta's Proposal"), Ziarul Financiar, 29 June 2012; accessed 2 July 2012 "Andronescu, despre cererea lui Băsescu: Este jignitor pentru cariera mea profesională" ("Andronescu, about Băsescu's Request: It Is Demeaning for My Professional Career") , România Liberă, 2 July 2012; accessed 2 July 2012 That November, integru.org, a Romanian website run by anonymous academics and focused on plagiarism detection charged that for a 2003 article, Andronescu and her co-author had lifted significant passages without attribution from three other works. The allegations were published by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung; in response, the minister stated that her actions did not amount to plagiarism. Liviu Avram, "Ecaterina Andronescu e şi ea acuzată de plagiat" ("Ecaterina Andronescu too Is Accused of Plagiarism"), Adevărul, 29 November 2012; accessed 1 December 2012 Andreea Ciulac, "Încă un ministru 'copy-paste'" ("Yet Another 'Copy-Paste' Minister"), Evenimentul Zilei, 29 November 2012; accessed 2 December 2012 Also in the same period, an article in Nature charged she had signed off on a plagiarized €500,000 research funding request; Marian Păvălaşc, "Ecaterina Andronescu, acuzată că a fost de acord cu un plagiat privind o finanțare în cercetare în valoare de 500.000 euro" ("Ecaterina Andronescu, Accused of Agreeing with a Plagiarized Research Finance Request for 500,000 Euros"), Evenimentul Zilei, 8 November 2012; accessed 2 December 2012 she denied ever having signed the document. Andreea Ciulac, "Androneasca se apără" ("Andronescu Defends Herself"), Evenimentul Zilei, 8 November 2012; accessed 2 December 2012 A third incident arose over an article published, with minor differences, four times between 2006 and 2007; integru.org alleged that Andronescu, whose name appeared on the authors' list the last three times but not the first, plagiarized the first group of authors. Liviu Avram, Oana Crăciun, "Anchetă la Fizica Materialelor pentru a elucida cel de-al treilea plagiat în care e implicată Ecaterina Andronescu" ("Material Physics Investigation into Third Plagiarism Accusation against Ecaterina Andronescu"), Adevărul, 3 December 2012; accessed 3 December 2012 At the December election, she retained her Senate seat with a nationwide high of 68%, "Ecaterina Andronescu, cel mai mare scor din ţară" ("Ecaterina Andronescu, Highest Score in the Country") , România Liberă, 10 December 2012; accessed 23 December 2012 but was not reappointed to Ponta's cabinet when it formed later in the month. Dorina Călin, "Ecaterina Andronescu, despre motivele pentru care nu mai e ministru" ("Ecaterina Andronescu, about Why She Is No Longer a Minister"), Adevărul, 19 December 2012; accessed 23 December 2012 In the Senate, she has served as president of the education committee since 2012. 2012- Profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site; accessed 29 May 2014 At the 2014 European Parliament election, she won a seat as an MEP. "Cine sunt cei 32 de europarlamentari români" ("Who Are the 32 Romanian MEPs"), Gândul, 26 May 2014; accessed 26 May 2014 However, Ponta, as party chief, persuaded her not to take office, saying she was too important domestically to be permitted a job abroad. Liviu Dădăcuş, "Ponta: Andronescu nu merge la PE, rămâne senator, preşedinte al Comisiei pentru educaţie" ("Ponta: Andronescu Is Not Going to EP, Remains Senator, Education Committee President"), Mediafax, 29 May 2014; accessed 29 May 2014 She was returned to the Senate at the 2016 parliamentary election.

Within her party, Andronescu has held several posts since 1997: vice-president of its Bucharest chapter; member of the central executive bureau; member of the national council; vice president, since 2010; Florin Ciornei, "'PSD, un 'dosar' greu pentru procurorul Victor Ponta" ("PSD, a Difficult 'Dossier' for Prosecutor Victor Ponta"), Evenimentul Zilei, 22 February 2010; accessed 13 July 2010 and interim president of its Bucharest chapter, since 2012.

The following year, she became a corresponding member of the Baia Mare Technical Academy. She holds honorary doctorates from five Romanian universities.

Fourth Minister of Education term
Following the resignation of Valentin Popa after a controversy regarding the teaching of the Romanian language in areas with Hungarian ethnic majorities, Andronescu was nominated for a fourth time to occupy the Education Ministry. She was removed from office on 2 August 2019 by prime minister Viorica Dăncilă following a controversial statement that "young girls should know better than to get in cars with strangers" regarding the kidnapping of Alexandra Măceșanu and Luiza Melencu.
