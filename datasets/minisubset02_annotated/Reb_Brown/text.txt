Acting career

"It could blow 'Yor' mind". Daily News (New York, New York). p. 11. However, the film was a financial success. The director stated that Columbia distributed 1400 prints of the film and that it was "one of the most successful pictures of my life." The film grossed $2,810,199 at the US box office and ranked 121 as one of the top earners of that year.

Also that year he was in the supporting cast of Ted Kotcheff's Uncommon Valor. He played Blaster, a Vietnam veteran character who trains with other vets in a P.O.W. rescue operation. The film was a box-office hit, one of the top-earning films of 1983. This was considered a surprise at the time because of the film's lack of stars and the fact it had a lot of competition.

In 1985, Brown starred in Philippe Mora's Howling II: Your Sister Is a Werewolf.

Winters said he hired Brown for the lead was due to the positive reviews he received for a previous Australian film and that he hired his wife Cisse Cameron because Brown asked if he had a part for her.
