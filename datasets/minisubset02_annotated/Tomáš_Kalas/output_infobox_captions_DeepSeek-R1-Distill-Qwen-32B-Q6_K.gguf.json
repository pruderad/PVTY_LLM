        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to determine whether Tomáš Kalas is present in the image described by the caption and estimate his age if possible. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt to extract Kalas's name and date of birth. The excerpt clearly states that Tomáš Kalas was born on 15 May 1993. So, his birth year is 1993.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"Kalas lining up for [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in 2018.\" The caption mentions Kalas explicitly, indicating that he is present in the image. The year mentioned is 2018.\n\nNow, I need to estimate his age. Since the image is from 2018, I'll subtract his birth year from 2018: 2018 - 1993 = 25. So, Kalas would be 25 years old in 2018.\n\nFor the probability of his presence, the caption explicitly states that Kalas is lining up for the Czech Republic team. This is a clear indication, so I'll assign a high probability, around 0.98.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention the explicit mention in the caption, the year, and the calculated age. The JSON structure will reflect this with the appropriate values.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Tomáš Kalas is lining up for the Czech Republic national football team in 2018.
