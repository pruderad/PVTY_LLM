        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to determine if Tomáš Kalas is present in the image described by the caption and estimate his age if possible. \n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt to extract Kalas's name and date of birth. From the excerpt, I see that Tomáš Kalas was born on 15 May 1993. That's clear.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"upright|Kalas warming up for Chelsea in 2014.\" The caption explicitly mentions \"Kalas,\" which is the subject's last name, and states that he is warming up for Chelsea in 2014. This suggests that the image is of Kalas during a Chelsea warm-up session in that year.\n\nNow, to determine the probability of Kalas being present. The caption directly names him and describes his activity, which is a clear indication that he is in the image. Since there's an explicit mention, according to the guidelines, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category, which suggests a high probability. I think a probability of 0.98 is appropriate here, as it's almost certain.\n\nFor the age estimation, I know Kalas was born in 1993, and the image is from 2014. Subtracting 1993 from 2014 gives 21 years. However, since his birthday is on 15 May, if the image was taken before May 15, 2014, he would still be 20 years old. If it's after, he would be 21. But the caption doesn't specify the exact date within 2014. To be precise, I should consider the possibility of either age. However, without more information, it's safer to go with the year difference, which is 21 years old.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should state that the caption explicitly shows Kalas warming up for Chelsea in 2014, making his presence certain and his age approximately 21.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Tomáš Kalas is warming up for Chelsea in 2014.

The image caption is \"upright|Kalas (right) playing for the Czech Republic in 2018.\" \n\nFirst, the name \"Kalas\" matches Tomáš Kalas from the excerpt. The caption explicitly mentions him playing for the Czech Republic in 2018, which suggests he is in the image. \n\nNext, I'll calculate his age. He was born on May 15, 1993. In 2018, he would be 25 years old (2018 - 1993 = 25). \n\nFor the probability, since the caption directly states his presence, a high probability like 0.98 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Tomáš Kalas is in the image, playing for the Czech Republic in 2018.
