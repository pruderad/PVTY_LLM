Gerry Norquist (born May 29, 1962) is an American professional golfer.

Norquist was born in Portland, Oregon and turned professional relatively late at the age of 26. He played most of his tournament golf in Asia, predominantly on the Asian Tour where he won five titles, and later on the Japan Golf Tour. His five wins on the Asian Tour are the most for an American. His biggest win came in 1999 at the European Tour co-sanctioned Benson and Hedges Malaysian Open, which gave him a two-year exemption on that tour.

Norquist maintained his links with the Asian Tour and was appointed senior vice president in 2006.

He was active on the European Seniors Tour in 2012; playing in 14 events, making the cut 12 times.  His best finish was a tie for 6th at the Taiwan-based Fubon Senior Open.
