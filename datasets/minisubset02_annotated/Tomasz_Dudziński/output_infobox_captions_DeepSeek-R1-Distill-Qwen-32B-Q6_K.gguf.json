        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to figure out if Tomasz Dudziński is present in the image based on the provided caption. The Wikipedia excerpt gives his birth year as 1973 and mentions he's a living politician. The image caption simply says \"Tomasz Dudziński.\" \n\nSince the caption explicitly names him, it's a direct indication that he's in the image. There's no mention of a portrait or statue, so it's likely a photo of him. \n\nNow, for the probability score. The name match is explicit, so according to the guidelines, the probability should be high, between 0.9 and 1.0. I'll go with 0.98 as in the example.\n\nNext, estimating his age. The current year isn't provided, but since he's born in 1973 and is alive, if the image is from the present time, he'd be around 49 years old (assuming current year is 2022). However, without the specific year, the age can't be precisely determined. Wait, but the image caption doesn't mention a year. Hmm, maybe I should check if the year can be inferred from the context. The Wikipedia excerpt mentions his election in 2005, but the image caption doesn't tie to a specific event or year. \n\nWait, the image caption just has his name. So, without a year mentioned or inferred, I can't calculate his age. Therefore, the estimated age should be \"unknown.\" But wait, the example where the caption had a year allowed age calculation. Since this caption doesn't have a year, even though the person is present, the age remains unknown.\n\nSo, putting it all together: high probability he's present, but age is unknown because no year is given in the caption.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Tomasz Dudziński is in the image. However, without a specific year, his age cannot be determined.\",\n\"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n\"estimated_age\": \"unknown\""
