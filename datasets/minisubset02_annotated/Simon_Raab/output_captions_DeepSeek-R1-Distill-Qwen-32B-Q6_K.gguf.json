        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to determine if Simon Raab is present in the image described by the caption. The caption says it's a Parleau Sculpture \"Complexification\" from 2011 by Simon Raab. So, the sculpture is by him, but does that mean he's in the image? \n\nFrom the guidelines, if the caption refers to a sculpture or artwork by the person, it's considered a low probability. The image is likely showing the sculpture itself, not Simon Raab. So, the presence probability should be low, maybe around 0.10.\n\nNext, estimating his age. He was born in 1952, and the sculpture is from 2011. Subtracting 1952 from 2011 gives 59 years old. But since he's not in the image, the age is just an estimate if he were present.\n\nSo, the explanation should mention that the caption refers to a sculpture by him, not his presence. The probability is low, and the age is calculated based on the sculpture's year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption refers to a sculpture by Simon Raab, not his presence in the image.

        "generated_response": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether Simon Raab is present in the image described by the caption. The Wikipedia excerpt says he's an artist and scientist, born in 1952. The image caption is \"Parleau Wall Work 'Andy Boom' (2012) by Simon Raab.\" \n\nHmm, the caption mentions that it's a work by Simon Raab. So, does that mean he's in the image? Well, the image is of his artwork, not necessarily him. It's a wall work, so it's likely showing the sculpture or painting itself. \n\nLooking at the guidelines, if the caption refers to a portrait, statue, or object depicting the person, the probability is low. Since this is his artwork, not a portrait of him, it's similar to a statue or object. So, the presence probability should be low, maybe around 0.10.\n\nNow, estimating his age. The artwork is from 2012, and he was born in 1952. Subtracting, 2012 - 1952 = 60 years old. But since the image is of his work, not him, does that affect the age calculation? The guidelines say to calculate age if the year is present, even if he's not in the image. So, his age would be 60.\n\nThe explanation should mention that the caption refers to his artwork, not his presence, and calculate his age based on the artwork's year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption refers to Simon Raab's artwork, not his presence. The artwork was created in 2012, making him approximately 60 years old that year.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.10,\n  \"estimated_age\": 60"
