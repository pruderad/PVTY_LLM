On January 23, 2023, two days after the 2023 Monterey Park Shooting, McGurn published an op-ed titled, "Are There “Too Many Asians”?" in the Wall Street Journal opinion section, receiving public outrage over the insensitivity and racism perceived in the choice of title. In response, the article was later renamed "China and the Population Bomb That Wasn’t". Despite public reactions to the title, the article was actually decrying the long-term Western policies and perspectives that were instrumental in forming the Chinese "one child" policy. The article ended by decrying the fact that recognitions of the harms inherent in such a policy came 50 years too late.
