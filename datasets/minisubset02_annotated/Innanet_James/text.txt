James has stated that Lil Wayne's mixtape Da Drought 3, particularly the "Upgrade U" freestyle was the most influential record in molding his career as a rapper. He draws inspiration from the Wu Tang Clan, 50 Cent, Amy Winehouse, and Smokey Robinson, but typically writes what is in his environment. He has stated that he has been composing rap since he was in the third grade. Before finding success within the rap industry, James worked at a DSW and took graphic design classes.
