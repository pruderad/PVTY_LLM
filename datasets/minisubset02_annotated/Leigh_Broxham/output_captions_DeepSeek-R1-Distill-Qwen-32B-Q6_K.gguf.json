        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to determine whether Leigh Broxham is present in the image described by the given caption. The Wikipedia excerpt provides his name, birth date (13 January 1988), and details about his soccer career, including his time with Melbourne Victory. The image caption is \"left|161px|Broxham playing for Melbourne Victory in 2010.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if the person's name is explicitly mentioned in the caption. The caption clearly states \"Broxham playing for Melbourne Victory in 2010.\" Since his full name is Leigh Michael Broxham, but the caption uses the last name, it's a direct reference. This suggests that the image does include him.\n\nNext, I need to determine the probability that he's present. Since the caption explicitly mentions his name and the team he's playing for, along with the year, this falls under an explicit name match. According to the guidelines, this should have a high probability, so I'll assign a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. Given the direct mention, 0.98 seems appropriate.\n\nNow, for estimating his age. The image is from 2010, and his birth year is 1988. Subtracting 1988 from 2010 gives 22 years old. So, his estimated age at the time of the image is 22.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention the explicit name match, the presence of the year, and the calculation of his age. The JSON structure will include the explanation, the probability, and the estimated age.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Broxham is playing for Melbourne Victory in 2010.
