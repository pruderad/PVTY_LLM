        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to figure out if Leigh Broxham is present in the image based on the given Wikipedia excerpt and the image caption. Let me start by extracting the necessary information.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia excerpt, I see that Leigh Michael Broxham was born on 13 January 1988. He's an Australian soccer player who played for Melbourne Victory FC, among other clubs. The excerpt mentions his extensive career with Melbourne Victory, including his role as captain and various milestones.\n\nLooking at the image caption: \"Broxham with [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in 2018.\" The caption explicitly mentions Broxham's name along with Melbourne Victory and the year 2018. This suggests that the image is of Broxham during his time with Melbourne Victory in that specific year.\n\nNow, determining the probability of his presence. Since the caption directly names him and his team, this falls under an explicit name match. According to the guidelines, this should be a high probability, probably around 0.95 to 0.98. I'll go with 0.98 as it's a direct mention.\n\nNext, estimating his age. He was born in 1988, and the image is from 2018. Subtracting 1988 from 2018 gives 30 years old. So, his estimated age is 30.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation would state that the caption clearly shows Broxham is present, and using his birth year and the image year, his age is calculated as 30.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Leigh Broxham is with Melbourne Victory in 2018. Born in 1988, he would be 30 years old in that year.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 30"
