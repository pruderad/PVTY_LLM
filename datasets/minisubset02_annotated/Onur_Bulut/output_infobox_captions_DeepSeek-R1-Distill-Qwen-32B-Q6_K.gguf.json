        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to determine if Onur Bulut is present in the image described by the caption and estimate his age if possible. Let's start by analyzing the Wikipedia excerpt to extract his name and date of birth. The excerpt clearly states that Onur Bulut was born on 16 April 1994. So, his birth year is 1994.\n\nNext, I'll look at the image caption: \"Bulut with [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] in 2023.\" The caption explicitly mentions Bulut, which is his last name, and associates him with Beşiktaş in the year 2023. From the Wikipedia excerpt, I know that Onur Bulut joined Beşiktaş on 8 February 2023, so this makes sense.\n\nSince the caption directly mentions Bulut alongside Beşiktaş and specifies the year, it's a clear indication that he is present in the image. There's no ambiguity here, so the probability should be high. According to the guidelines, an explicit name match falls into the 0.9-1.0 range. I'll assign a probability of 0.98 as it's very certain.\n\nNow, estimating his age. He was born in 1994, and the image is from 2023. Subtracting 1994 from 2023 gives 29 years old. However, since his birthday is on 16 April, if the image was taken before April 16, 2023, he would still be 28. But without the exact date, it's safe to assume he turned 29 in 2023, making him 29 years old.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the explanation will state that the caption explicitly shows Bulut with Beşiktaş in 2023, and his age is estimated based on his birth year. The probability is high, and the age is 29.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Bulut is with Beşiktaş in 2023. Born in 1994, he would be 29 years old.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 29"
