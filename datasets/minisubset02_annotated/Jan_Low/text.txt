Low was born in 1955 in Denver, Colorado. She attended Pomona College and spent four years in Zaire with the Peace Corps before earning a doctorate in agricultural economics at Cornell University in 1994.

Career

After Cornell, Low began working at the Nairobi office of the CGIAR International Potato Center, a research center based in Lima, Peru. She helped develop the biofortified orange-fleshed sweet potato, which contains more vitamin A than the dominant variant, and can therefore be used to help alleviate the vitamin A deficiency common among children in the region.

Recognition
2016 World Food Prize (co-recipient)
