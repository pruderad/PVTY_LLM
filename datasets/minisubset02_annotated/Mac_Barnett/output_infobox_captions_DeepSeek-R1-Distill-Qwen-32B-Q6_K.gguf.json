The excerpt doesn't provide his exact birth year, but he's listed as a living person. \n\nThe image caption explicitly mentions \"Barnett in 2018,\" which directly refers to the person in question. Since the name is explicitly stated, according to the guidelines, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category, which suggests a high probability of presence. \n\nNext, I need to estimate his age. The caption mentions the year 2018. However, the Wikipedia excerpt doesn't provide his birth year. Without a birth year, I can't calculate his age. Therefore, the estimated age should be \"unknown.\"\n\nConsidering the probability, since the name is explicitly mentioned, the probability should be high, around 0.98.\n</think>\n\n{\n\"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Mac Barnett is in the image from 2018. However, his birth year is not provided in the Wikipedia excerpt, so his age cannot be estimated.\",\n\"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n\"estimated_age\": \"unknown\""
