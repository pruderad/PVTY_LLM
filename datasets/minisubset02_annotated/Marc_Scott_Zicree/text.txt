He has also contributed to the Magic Time novel trilogy, a collaborative effort between Zicree and three other science fiction writers.

Space Command
With writer Michael Reaves and director Neil Johnson, and using crowd funding for financing, Zicree is working on a series of films under the umbrella title Space Command. A Kickstarter project page, launched by Zicree in May 2012, raised funds of $75,000 (its initial goal) in three days, and went on to raise over $220,000 during the Kickstarter campaign, making it one of the most successful crowd funding campaign as of that date.

The Space Command series features Doug Jones, Robert Picardo, Bill Mumy, Mira Furlan, Bruce Boxleitner, Nichelle Nichols, Barbara Bain, Christina Moses, Elizabeth Chamberlain, Ethan McDowell, Bryan McClure, with Neil deGrasse Tyson appearing as himself.

The film Space Command Redemption was released in 2024 with Zicree appearing as the Grizzled Space Jockey.
