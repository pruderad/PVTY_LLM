Mathis Amougou (born 18 January 2006) is a French professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Chelsea.

Early life
Born in Le Blanc-Mesnil, Amougou has three brothers; one elder, a twin and one younger, all of whom also play football. He first took an interest in football as a child, accompanying his elder brother to his football training sessions in Sevran, though he was not able to register with any club as he was too young.

Club career
Early career
After his family moved to La Ferté-Gaucher, Amougou began his career with local side Entente Brie Est, spending two seasons before a move to Torcy in 2014. While at Torcy, he was also enrolled at the prestigious football academy INF Clairefontaine.

Saint-Étienne
Amougou who had already been training with the academy of professional side Saint-Étienne, moved officially in July 2021.

After a year playing youth football with Saint-Étienne, he was promoted to the club's second team, competing in the Championnat National 3. Mid-way through his first season in senior football, in April 2023, he signed his first professional contract with the club, penning a two-year deal.

After making his senior debut on 13 January 2024 in a goalless draw against Laval in Ligue 2, he established himself as a more regular starter during the first half of the 2024–25 Ligue 1.

Chelsea
On 3 February 2025, Amougou signed an eight-year contract with Premier League club Chelsea, for a reported transfer fee of €15 million.

International career
Of Cameroonian descent, Amougou is eligible to represent both Cameroon and France at international level. In 2022, following impressive performances for Saint-Étienne's youth team, French national youth coach Jean-Luc Vannuchi called him up for a double-header against Germany, and he made his under-16 debut in the second of these two games.

Despite this being his only appearance for the under-16 squad, he remained a player of interest for Vannuchi, and having impressed at both under-17 and under-18 level, he was called up to the squad for the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup. In France's second game against South Korea, Amougou's goal in the 2nd-minute lead France to a 1–0 win, ensuring his nation progressed to the knockout stages.
