        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to determine if Stephen Robinson, also known as Corporal Robinson, is present in the image described by the given caption. The image caption is: \"upright|Corporal Robinson performing the 'Boot Camp' from the second rope on Mad Man Pondo.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the Wikipedia excerpt. It mentions that Stephen Robinson, as Corporal Robinson, is a professional wrestler known for his hardcore style. He has wrestled in various promotions and has held multiple championships. The excerpt also includes details about his personal life and other aspects of his career.\n\nNow, focusing on the image caption. It explicitly mentions \"Corporal Robinson performing the 'Boot Camp' from the second rope on Mad Man Pondo.\" The name \"Corporal Robinson\" is clearly stated, indicating that the person in the image is indeed Stephen Robinson. \n\nNext, I need to check if there's a year mentioned or if it can be inferred. The image caption doesn't provide a specific year. It just describes an action (performing a move) in a wrestling context. Without a year, I can't calculate his age. \n\nSo, the subject is present in the image, and the probability is high because the caption explicitly names him. The estimated age is unknown since there's no year provided.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON response should reflect that Corporal Robinson is present with a high probability, and his age is unknown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Corporal Robinson performing a move, confirming his presence. No year is provided to estimate his age.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": \"unknown\""
