        "generated_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if Stephen Robinson, also known as Corporal Robinson, is present in the image described by the caption. The Wikipedia excerpt provides a lot of information about his career, championships, and personal life. \n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt to extract his name and date of birth. His name is Stephen Robinson, or Corporal Robinson, and he was born on November 27, 1975. That's important because I'll need this to calculate his age if possible.\n\nNext, I'll look at the image caption: \"Corporal Robinson at an Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South live event in May 2008.\" The caption explicitly mentions Corporal Robinson, so it seems like he's present in the image. \n\nNow, I need to determine the probability that he's in the image. Since the caption directly names him, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category, which suggests a high probability. I think a score of 0.98 would be appropriate here, as it's almost certain he's present.\n\nMoving on to estimating his age. The caption mentions the event took place in May 2008. Since Stephen was born in 1975, subtracting that from 2008 gives us 33 years old. Wait, but he was born in November, so in May 2008, he would have just turned 32 or be about to turn 33. Hmm, maybe I should round it to 33, considering it's close to his birthday.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of a portrait or statue, but the caption refers to a live event, so it's likely he's physically present. There's no indication of any indirect references or objects, so the probability remains high.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation would be that the caption clearly states Corporal Robinson is at the event, and based on his birth year, he's approximately 33 years old in 2008. The probability is high, so I'll assign 0.98, and the estimated age is 33.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Corporal Robinson is at the event in May 2008.
