Elo Viiding (pen name, Elo Vee; born 20 March 1974) is an Estonian poet and prose writer.

Family
Viiding is the third poet in her family. Her father, Juhan Viiding was a famous and influential poet in the 1970s. He was also an actor. Her paternal grandfather, Paul Viiding, was a poet, author and literary critic and member of Arbujad in the 1930s, and her paternal grandmother was translator Linda Viiding. Her maternal grandfather, Kaljo Kiisk, was an actor, film director and politician. Viiding's mother Riina was a music teacher.

Education
Viiding, inspired by her father's career as an actor and her mother's love for music, graduated from school in 1999 as an actress.  She studied violin.

Literary career
Viiding debuted under a pseudonym ("Elo Vee") in 1991. She published four anthologies under her pseudonym. After her father's death in 1995, she began to publish her works under her real name.

Themes and style

Viiding writes mainly about the oppressed. It is her opinion that every person is controlled and oppressed by someone else. She also uses her poetry to address what she sees as shortcomings in the Estonian educational system. She writes directly to her reader and her tone is extremely ironic. When her poetry is compared with that of other Estonian writers, it seems to be more masculine than feminine.
