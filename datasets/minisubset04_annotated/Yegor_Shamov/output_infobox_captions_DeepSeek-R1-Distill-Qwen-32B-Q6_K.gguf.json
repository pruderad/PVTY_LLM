The caption says, \"Shamov with Arsenal Tula in 2019.\" That explicitly mentions his name and the club, so he's definitely in the image. \n\nNext, I should check if there's a year mentioned. The caption clearly states \"2019,\" so I can use that. \n\nLooking at the Wikipedia excerpt, Yegor was born on June 2, 1994. To estimate his age in 2019, I subtract 1994 from 2019, which gives 25. \n\nFor the probability, since the caption explicitly names him and the club, I'll assign a high probability, maybe 0.98. \n\nSo, putting it all together: he's present, age 25, probability 0.98.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Yegor Shamov is in the image with Arsenal Tula in 2019.
