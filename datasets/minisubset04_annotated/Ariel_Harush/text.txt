Ariel Harush (or Harosh, ; born 25 May 1988) is an Israeli footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for F.C. Ashdod and the Israel national team.

Harush's time at Beitar Jerusalem was featured in the 2016 documentary Forever Pure, where he stood against racism and hate from the fans toward two new Muslim Chechnyan players. Harush was ultimately hounded out the club by the right-wing fanbase La Familia and left to play for Maccabi Netanya.

Harush and teammate Tomer Hemed were suspended by the Israeli national team for two games in 2017 after criticising manager Elisha Levy.

Early life
Harush was born in Jerusalem, Israel, to a Sephardic Jewish family.
