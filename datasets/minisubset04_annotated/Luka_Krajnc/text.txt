Luka Krajnc (born 19 September 1994) is a Slovenian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Slovenian PrvaLiga club Maribor.

Club career
Krajnc began his football career at the age of eight, when his father took him to the Slovenian club Maribor for a trial. He signed his first professional contract with Maribor at the age of 16 and played for the main squad in a couple of friendly matches. On 29 May 2011, he played his first and only 1. SNL match for Maribor in the last round of the 2010–11 season, with Maribor already being crowned champions. At the time of his debut, he was the youngest player ever with an appearance for Maribor in a 1. SNL match, a record which lasted until 25 March 2012 when it was surpassed by Petar Stojanović.

On 3 April 2011, Krajnc signed a pre-contract with Italian Serie A club Genoa. The transfer fee paid by Genoa was undisclosed, but was reported to be close to €1 million. He joined his new club on 1 July 2011 and was assigned to Genoa's youth team, which he also captained, before making his debut for the first team on 27 October 2012 at San Siro in a league match against AC Milan. With 18 years, one month and 14 days, he became the youngest Slovenian player with an appearance in the Italian top division, Serie A.

On 3 July 2013, he moved to Cesena in a temporary co-ownership deal. In June 2015, Genoa acquired Cesena's share and became the sole owner of the player's rights.

On 31 August 2016, Krajnc joined Sampdoria on a season-long loan. In the second part of the 2016–17 season, he was loaned to Frosinone.

On 20 June 2018, Frosinone turned Krajnc's loan into a permanent deal for an undisclosed fee.

In September 2020, he joined Fortuna Düsseldorf on a season-long loan.

On 24 August 2021, Krajnc joined Hannover 96 on a three-year contract.

On 23 August 2023, Krajnc returned to Italy and signed a two-year deal with Catanzaro.

After 13 years of playing abroad, Krajnc returned to his childhood club Maribor on 7 September 2024 and signed a contract until 2026 with the option for another year.

International career
Krajnc has represented Slovenia at all youth levels from under-16 to under-21. He made his senior international debut on 30 March 2015, replacing Dominic Maroh after 65 minutes in an eventual 1–0 friendly defeat against Qatar at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha.

Personal life
Krajnc is from Kapla na Kozjaku in the hilly region of northeastern Slovenia near the Austrian border, roughly 37 km from the city of Maribor. Before moving to Maribor he usually had to study and do his homework on the back seat of his father's car, traveling to and from training.
