Unification and Civil War
Following the unification of South Yemen with the Yemen Arab Republic in 1990, he took up the position of vice-president in the transition government of unified Yemen. But in 1993, Ali quit the government and returned to the former Southern capital of Aden, claiming that the new government was systematically marginalizing the southern people and ignoring the needs of the south. On 21 May 1994, as the South's military position weakened, Ali declared the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He served as the only President of the DRY, from 21 May to 7 July 1994. Ali fled to neighbouring Oman after the secession failed.

South Yemen movement
After fifteen years of living in exile, Ali Salim al-Beidh resumed his political career on the eve of the 19th anniversary of the Yemeni unification. This came amid highly escalating tensions in the south, with clashes and violence between protesters and Yemeni security forces. In a televised speech from Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, the former President called for a return of South Yemen. Since then he has called for several demonstrations to demonstrate the strength of the movement.Rally in Aden These have continued into 2011. As a result of his increased involvement, he lost his right to stay in Oman after violating the conditions of his citizenship. Following the 2011 Yemeni uprising, he renewed calls for reinstating South Yemen as a separate country.
