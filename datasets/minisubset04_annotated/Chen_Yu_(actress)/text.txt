 Early life 
Chen Yu was born on 7 May 1994, in Taiwan, into a family of five.  Her father is an audio recording engineer, her mother is a voice actress, and she has two older brothers. After graduating from the Department of Theater Arts at Chinese Culture University, Chen Yu has been involved in performing since childhood, due to his experiences of participating in cartoon voice acting.  During high school, she was active in school events and activities, taking advantage of the opportunity of performing in the strict private school she attended.  "At school with such strict rules, joining in practicing dancing and rehearsing is the time to 'take a breath'." She said in the interview with Flipped Education that she enjoyed participating in group works and performing on the stage.  

However, Chen Yu did not think of becoming an actress before getting into college.  In fact, she had decided to study biology or chemistry due to her academic performance in those subjects.  When applying for colleges, Chen Yu put Department of Theater Arts as her last choice on the list only because her mother graduated from the department.  Walking on the acting path out of coincidence, Chen Yu met her abecedarian, Yen Ling Hsu, just after getting into college.  Professor Hsu had not only enlightened her in performing but also impacted her sense of values.

Being brought up by a domestic worker in the family, Chen Yu initially had a difficult relationship with her parents.  Chen Yu had been raised like a boy, like her two brothers. She thought "Between working and taking care of children, my parents chose the former."   After growing up, Chen Yu gradually reconciled with her parents. She started to consider her mother as an advice-giver, and her father as a problem-solver.  Chen Yu has been deeply influenced by her family.  Chen Yu shared her father’s words in her interview: "Life is like a sponge.  You need to learn as long as you can because you don’t know when things will come in handy."

 Acting career 

 2014–2016 
In 2014, Chen Yu was studying in the department of Drama and Theatre at Chinese Culture University and started to participate in stage shows. In 2015, she became a trainee in the acting training of QPlace, furthermore, the training after being selected helped Chen Yu truly realize her true calling as an actress.

 2016–2018 
In 2016, Chen Yu made her debut as an actress, and her casting began for Love of Sandstorm filmed by Qseries.  In her personal interview, she revealed that the most challenging thing for her was to perform crying. When she read the script, she thought she could cry; however, she could not cry when acting.

When Chen Yu acted in The World Between Us, she liked her role very much, and the role she played was vivid for her. However, Chen Yu was too concerned about gain and loss and too eager to be good, so she thought she performed not that well. After that, she could adjust her mentality better.

It was her first time attending a game show, which was quite different from being an actress. She had to join physical training for up to six months and endure the impact of an injury on her work schedule. Being able to be recognized by the audience through this reality show is another kind of luck. She can show her true personality in front of the audience without reservation.
