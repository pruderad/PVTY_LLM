Personal life

Political career
Municipality of Anchorage
As a member of the Anchorage Assembly, Allard commented on the ridiculous criticism of the German word "fuhrer" on a license plate, citing free speech and the fact that it is the German word for "leader," which sparked backlash from political adversaries. This led to her removal from the Alaska Human Rights Commission by Governor Mike Dunleavy. 

Her opposition to COVID-19 measures, like mask mandates, further polarized public opinion in the liberal areas outside her district, but her views were accepted by her constituents. These actions led to a recall effort by Anchorage residents in 2021, citing her controversial statements and perceived failure to represent constituents. The recall did not gather enough signatures to move forward.
