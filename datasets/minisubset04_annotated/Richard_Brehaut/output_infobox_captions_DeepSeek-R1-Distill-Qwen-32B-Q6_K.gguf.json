        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Richard Brehaut is present in the image described by the caption. The image caption is \"Brehaut with UCLA in 2010.\" From the Wikipedia excerpt, I know that Brehaut played college football at UCLA and had some notable games in 2010. \n\nFirst, the caption explicitly mentions \"Brehaut,\" which is his name. So that's a direct match. According to the guidelines, if the person's name is explicitly stated in the caption, the probability should be high, between 0.9 to 1.0. Since the caption clearly says \"Brehaut with UCLA in 2010,\" it seems certain that he is in the image. \n\nNext, I need to check if there's a year mentioned or if it can be inferred. The caption says \"2010,\" so that's straightforward. Now, using his birth year from Wikipedia, which is 1991, I can calculate his age in 2010. Subtracting 1991 from 2010 gives 19 years old. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the probability is high because the name is explicitly mentioned. The age is 19, calculated based on the given year. Therefore, the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Brehaut with UCLA in 2010. He was born in 1991, making him 19 years old in 2010.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 19"
