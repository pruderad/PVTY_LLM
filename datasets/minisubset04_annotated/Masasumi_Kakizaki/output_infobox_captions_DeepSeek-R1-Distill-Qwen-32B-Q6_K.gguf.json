        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a Wikipedia excerpt about a manga artist and an image caption. My task is to determine if the person from Wikipedia is present in the image, estimate their age if possible, and provide a structured JSON response.\n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt carefully. The artist's name isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the categories, it mentions \"1978 births\" and \"Living people.\" So, the person was born in 1978 and is still alive. The excerpt lists their works, debut year, and awards, but the name isn't provided. However, the image caption refers to \"Kakizaki\" at Lucca Comics & Games in 2014.\n\nWait, the Wikipedia excerpt doesn't mention the name \"Kakizaki.\" Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe \"Kakizaki\" is the name of the manga artist in question. Since the image caption explicitly mentions \"Kakizaki,\" I'll assume that's the person from the Wikipedia excerpt.\n\nNext, I need to determine if Kakizaki is present in the image. The caption says \"Kakizaki at Lucca Comics & Games in 2014.\" That's a direct mention, so the presence is confirmed. Now, I'll assign a high probability, probably around 0.98, as it's explicit.\n\nNow, estimating the age. The person was born in 1978, and the image is from 2014. Subtracting 1978 from 2014 gives 36 years old. So, the estimated age is 36.\n\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity. Since the Wikipedia excerpt doesn't provide the name but the image caption does, and given the context of manga awards and works, it's reasonable to link them. There's no indication that the image is a portrait or statue, so the presence is straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation will state that the caption explicitly mentions Kakizaki, and using the birth year from Wikipedia, we calculate his age in 2014.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Kakizaki at an event in 2014. Based on the birth year from Wikipedia, he would be 36 years old in 2014.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 36"
