Lewis John Strapp (born 26 November 1999) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a left-sided defender for Airdrieonians.

Club career
Strapp joined the Greenock Morton youth academy on its inception in 2012, before signing professional forms shortly after his 16th birthday.

Strapp made his debut for Morton in a Scottish League Cup tie against Albion Rovers in July 2016. He joined Elgin City on loan in August 2017 until January 2018.

In June 2018, Strapp signed with Morton for another season.

In late September 2018, Strapp and team-mate Ruaridh Langan joined Annan Athletic on a short-term development loan.

Strapp scored his first league goal for Morton with the late winner against Ayr United on Halloween 2020; he also opened the scoring with an own goal in the 32nd minute.

Strapp would go on to regularly feature for Morton, making his 100th appearance for the club in a 5-0 home win against Dunfermline Athletic. Strapp also scored his second career goal in a 0-1 away win against Inverness a few weeks later. Following much speculation about a potential move away from Morton, Strapp signed a one-year contract extension, expiring in summer 2023. In April 2023, it was revealed that Strapp would be leaving the club at the end of the season, and due to injury, Strapp's last appearance for Morton would be in a 5-0 away defeat to Celtic in the Scottish Cup in January 2023.

However, after months without a club, and having a trial at Kilmarnock, Strapp returned to Greenock Morton on 8 December 2023, signing a short term deal until the end of January. On 19 January 2024, Strapp signed a contract extension with the Ton until the end of the season.

On 26 June 2024, Strapp moved to Finland and signed with SJK in the country's top-tier Veikkausliiga. The transfer will be effective from 2 July 2024. On 19 December, SJK announced that Strapp would leave the club.Lewis Strapp ei jatka Kerhossa kaudella 2025, sjk.fi, 19 December 2024
