        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to figure out whether Rúben Guerreiro is present in the image described by the caption \"Guerreiro in 2015.\" Let me start by analyzing the Wikipedia excerpt to extract his name and date of birth.\n\nFrom the excerpt, his full name is Rúben António Almeida Guerreiro, and he was born on 6 July 1994. That's clear. Now, looking at the image caption, it directly mentions \"Guerreiro in 2015.\" The name matches exactly, so it seems like the person in the image is him.\n\nNext, I need to determine if the year is mentioned or can be inferred. The caption explicitly states \"2015,\" so the year is known. Now, to estimate his age, I subtract his birth year from 2015. 2015 minus 1994 equals 21. So, he would be 21 years old in 2015.\n\nRegarding the probability of his presence, since the caption explicitly names him, I should assign a high probability. According to the guidelines, an explicit name match falls into the 0.9-1.0 range. I'll go with 0.98 as it's a very high certainty.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention the explicit name match and the age calculation. The probability is high, and the age is 21.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Guerreiro is in the image from 2015.
