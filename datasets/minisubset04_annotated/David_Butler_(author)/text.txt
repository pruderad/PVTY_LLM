David Butler (born 1 January 1964) is an Irish novelist, short story writer, playwright, poet and actor. He has won several literary prizes, such as the Ted McNulty Award from Poetry Ireland and the Féile Filíochta International Award and the Fish Short Story Award.

Reception
Butler's work has been generally well received by critics, with a reviewer for the Sunday Times describing the main character of The Judas Kiss as being "among the more outlandishly repulsive creations of recent Irish fiction." Author Pat McCabe wrote of City of Dis, which was shortlisted for the Kerry Group Irish Novel of the Year 2015,  “David Butler's compelling mythic, metaphysical X-ray is beautifully written and ought to cement his already growing reputation.” while for the Kirkus Review, the award-winning novel is “A dark romp featuring delightfully crackling dialogue and the mental gymnastics of a protagonist so on edge he tries to silence a yowling cat with poison.”Kirkus Review (18 August 2015) https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-butler/city-of-dis/
