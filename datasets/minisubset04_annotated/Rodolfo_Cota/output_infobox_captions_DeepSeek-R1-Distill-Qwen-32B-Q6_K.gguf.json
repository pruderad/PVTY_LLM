        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Rodolfo Cota Robles is present in the image described by the caption. Let me start by looking at the Wikipedia excerpt. It says he was born on July 3, 1987, and he's a Mexican footballer. The image caption is \"Cota with Mexico national football team in 2018.\" \n\nFirst, I check if the name matches. The caption mentions \"Cota,\" which is his last name, so that's a direct reference. Since the Wikipedia excerpt is about Rodolfo Cota Robles, it's safe to assume the caption refers to him.\n\nNext, I need to determine if he's present in the image. The caption explicitly states \"Cota with Mexico national team in 2018,\" which suggests he is in the image. There's no mention of a portrait or statue, so it's likely a photo of him playing or representing the team.\n\nNow, for the age estimation. His birth year is 1987, and the image is from 2018. Subtracting 1987 from 2018 gives 31 years old. That seems straightforward.\n\nLooking at the probability guidelines, since the caption explicitly mentions his name and context, a high probability like 0.98 is appropriate. There's no ambiguity here; it's a clear mention.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the explanation would state that the caption explicitly includes him, and his age can be calculated based on the years given.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Cota with the Mexico national team in 2018. He was born in 1987, making him 31 years old that year.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 31"
