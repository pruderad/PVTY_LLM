 Career 
Marcimain worked for nine years as an assistant director in the film industry before he was offered to make the one-hour film Broken Hearts as part of SVT Drama's TV series A Little Red Package (1999).

Marcimain was nominated in the category Best Director. A scene in the film received a lot of attention in the media when relatives of former Swedish prime minister Olof Palme said that it portrayed him as a sex buyer of minors. Marcimain himself said that it was pure fiction, a feature film, and emphasized that he saw the film as a "women's film" that shows how power, the patriarchy, exploits the girls. 

In 2013, Marcimain started the filming of the film adaptation of Klas Östergren's novels Gentlemen and Gangsters, in which David Dencik plays the lead role as the dandy Henry Morgan. This will be the third time Marcimain and Dencik have worked together.

He often works with actors Ruth Vega Fernandez, David Dencik, Simon J. Berger and Sverrir Gudnason and has cited Bo Widerberg as a great role model in his filmmaking.
