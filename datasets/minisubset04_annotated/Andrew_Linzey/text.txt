Career
Linzey has written more than 180 articles, and authored or edited twenty books on theology and ethics. He has lectured and broadcast extensively in Europe and the United States. His Animal Theology has been translated into Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and French.

He is most often quoted as saying

He also said "Christians haven't got much further than thinking that the whole world was made for us, with the result that animals are only seen in an instrumental way as objects, machines, tools, and commodities, rather than fellow creatures", and it is claimed that he "wants to see animal abusers placed on a register and forbidden from keeping an animal, or working with them."

Honours
In 1990, he was awarded the Peaceable Kingdom Medal for outstanding work in the field of theology and animals. In June 2001, he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, in recognition of his "unique and massive pioneering work in the area of the theology of creation with particular reference to the rights and welfare of Godâ€™s sentient creatures". This is the highest award that the Archbishop can bestow on a theologian and the first time it has been awarded for work involving animals. In 2006, in recognition of his role in the creation of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, Linzey was named the Henry Bergh Professor of Animal Ethics at the Graduate Theological Foundation in the US, the first such professorship of its kind in the world.
