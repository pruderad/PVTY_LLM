Artistic career
Prior to college Maybin received college level courses from Maryland Institute College of Art, and then majored in integrative arts at Penn State. His first commission as an artist was for the State of Maryland when Maybin was eleven years old. Maybin, one of four children, was one of the first people to attend college in his family. He then continued his art career throughout his NFL tenure. During his career his paintings were a major part of the Hard Knocks reality television show when it covered the Bengals. During this time, Maybin claims to have used the pressure and stress of performing in professional football to influence his artistic output.

Maybin focused on his art full-time after his NFL career, with paintings sold for as much as $20,000 as of 2013, and prints of his original sold online. He has also set about specific artistic projects. For example, following an incident he had with a police officer racial profiling him in Baltimore following in the first two weeks of the death of Freddie Gray, Maybin began a photography project in the surrounding area and painted images of the neighborhood as it reacted to the social trauma.

Maybin's studio is based in Baltimore, Maryland. He is also the founder of "Project Mayhem", taking his college football nickname, which performs non-profit artistic activities in the public. The foundation supports the artwork of students in the Baltimore area. In 2017 Maybin released the book Art Activism. In describing the book, The Undefeated wrote, "The work is both an ode to Maybin's hometown and a lament of the city's many challenges. He uses his paintings, photography, poetry and prose to convey both the pride and pain of Baltimore."

Personal life
Maybin was born to Constance and Michael Maybin in Baltimore. He was diagnosed with borderline attention deficit disorder when he was young. His parents sought out alternatives to drug treatment which included sketching, sculpting, wrestling, baseball and football, which he began play at the Pee-Wee level at the age of 5. When Maybin was 6, his mother died after going into cardiac arrest during child birth. His father later remarried to an English missionary, Violette Grant, whom Maybin calls his mother. He attended Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City.

While at Penn State, Maybin spoke frequently by phone with former Nittany Lion linebacker LaVar Arrington. The two first met during Arrington's stint with the Washington Redskins, when Maybin was playing at nearby Mount Hebron High School. Arrington has joked about knowing Maybin "before he had muscles." Arrington now serves as Maybin's manager.

In 2009, Maybin founded Project Mayhem, a charitable organization established to "provide aid, both personal and economic, to help underprivileged and at risk youth excel beyond their current conditions."

Maybin's cousin Cameron Maybin played in Major League Baseball.

Maybin was roommates with linebacker NaVorro Bowman while at Penn State. He pursued a double major in communications and integrative arts.  Maybin became a member of the Delta Theta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity in April 2008.
