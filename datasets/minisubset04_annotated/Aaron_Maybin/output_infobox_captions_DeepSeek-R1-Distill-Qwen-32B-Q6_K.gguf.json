        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a Wikipedia excerpt about Aaron Maybin and an image caption. My task is to determine if Maybin is present in the image, estimate his age if possible, and provide a probability score based on the guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the Wikipedia excerpt to extract the necessary information. It mentions that Aaron Maybin was born on April 6, 1988. He played professional football for teams like the Buffalo Bills, New York Jets, Cincinnati Bengals, and Toronto Argonauts. His professional career ended in 2013, after which he became a full-time artist.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"Maybin with the New York Jets in 2011.\" The caption explicitly states that Maybin is with the New York Jets in the year 2011. Since the name match is explicit, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category, which suggests a high probability of his presence in the image. According to the guidelines, this should be a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. Given that the name is clearly mentioned along with the team and year, I'll assign a probability of 0.98, which is on the higher end of the scale.\n\nNow, for estimating his age. The birth year is 1988, and the image is from 2011. Subtracting 1988 from 2011 gives 23 years old. However, since the exact date of the image isn't provided, we can assume that as of 2011, Maybin would have been 23 years old, considering his birthday in April. Therefore, the estimated age is 23.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should state that the caption explicitly mentions Maybin, making his presence highly probable. Additionally, the year allows us to calculate his age accurately.\n\nI need to ensure that I don't assume his presence without explicit mention. In this case, the caption clearly states his presence, so it's safe to assign a high probability. Also, since the year is provided, the age can be determined without ambiguity.\n\nFinally, structuring the JSON response as per the output format, I'll include the explanation, the probability score, and the estimated age.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Aaron Maybin is with the New York Jets in 2011. He was born in 1988, making him 23 years old in 2011.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 23"
