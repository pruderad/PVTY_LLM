        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to tackle this problem step by step. Let's start by understanding what's being asked. The task is to determine whether a person described in a Wikipedia excerpt is present in an image based on its caption. Additionally, I have to estimate the person's age if possible.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the Wikipedia excerpt provided. It mentions Lester Thomas Kirby, born on February 16, 1961. He's a politician, served in the Georgia House of Representatives, and ran for Congress. The excerpt also includes some references and categories, which might not be directly relevant here.\n\nNext, the image caption is \"Kirby in 2015.\" My first thought is that this directly refers to Lester Kirby, as the name is mentioned. So, the person is explicitly stated in the caption. That should give a high probability of presence.\n\nNow, moving on to estimating the age. The birth year is 1961, and the image is from 2015. Subtracting 1961 from 2015 gives 54 years. However, since the exact date isn't provided in the caption, just the year, I can confidently say he was 54 years old in 2015.\n\nConsidering the guidelines for assigning probability, since the caption explicitly states \"Kirby,\" it falls under the explicit name match category. Therefore, the probability should be high, around 0.98 or similar.\n\nI also need to structure the explanation clearly. It should mention that the caption explicitly includes Kirby and that his age can be calculated using his birth year and the image year.\n\nI don't see any issues here. The information is straightforward, and both the presence and age can be determined accurately. There's no ambiguity in the caption, so the probability is high, and the age is a precise calculation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Kirby is in the image from 2015. He was born in 1961, making him 54 years old in that year.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 54"
