        "generated_response": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this query. Let's see what the user provided. They have a Wikipedia excerpt about Brolle, a Swedish singer, and an image caption that says \"Brolle in 2008.\" My task is to determine if Brolle is present in the image, estimate his age if possible, and provide a structured JSON response.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the necessary information from the Wikipedia excerpt. Brolle's real name is Kjell Junior Wallmark, and he was born on November 10, 1981. That's important for calculating his age. The excerpt also mentions his career highlights, like being discovered in Popstars in 2001 and releasing several albums and singles. The discography lists his albums and singles with their respective years, which might help in inferring timelines.\n\nNow, looking at the image caption: \"Brolle in 2008.\" This seems pretty straightforward. The caption explicitly mentions Brolle and the year 2008. So, according to the guidelines, an explicit name match should have a high probability, between 0.9 and 1.0. Since the caption clearly states Brolle's presence and the year, I think a probability of 0.98 is appropriate, similar to the first example provided.\n\nNext, I need to estimate Brolle's age in 2008. He was born in 1981, so subtracting that from 2008 gives 27 years old. However, I should consider the exact date of birth. He was born on November 10, 1981. If the image was taken in 2008, depending on the month, he might have just turned 27 or still be 27. But since the caption only mentions the year, it's safe to go with 27 as his age.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the explanation should state that the caption explicitly mentions Brolle and the year 2008, making his presence certain. The probability is high, and his age can be calculated as 27.\n\nI should make sure the JSON structure is correct, with the explanation, probability, and age. Also, I need to avoid any markdown and keep the response clean. Double-checking everything, I think I've covered all the bases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Brolle is in the image from 2008. He was born in 1981, making him approximately 27 years old in 2008.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 27"
