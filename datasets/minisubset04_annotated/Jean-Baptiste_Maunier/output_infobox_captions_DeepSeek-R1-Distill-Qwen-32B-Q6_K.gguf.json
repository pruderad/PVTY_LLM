        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The user provided a Wikipedia excerpt about Jean-Baptiste Maunier and an image caption. My job is to determine if Maunier is present in the image, estimate his age if possible, and provide a structured JSON response with an explanation, probability, and age.\n\nStarting with the Wikipedia excerpt, I see that Maunier was born on December 22, 1990. That's his date of birth, which is crucial for calculating his age. \n\nNext, looking at the image caption: \"Maunier in 2016.\" This is pretty straightforward. The caption explicitly mentions Maunier and the year 2016. Since the name matches exactly, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category, which suggests a high probability of his presence in the image.\n\nNow, calculating his age. If the image was taken in 2016, subtracting his birth year (1990) from 2016 gives us 26 years old. However, since his birthday is in December, if the image was taken before December 22, he would still be 25. But without the exact date, it's safer to go with 26 as an approximate age.\n\nConsidering the guidelines for assigning probability, since the caption explicitly states Maunier's presence and the year, the probability should be high. The example given for explicit matches uses 0.98, so I'll go with that.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention the explicit name match and the calculation of age based on the given year. The probability is high, and the age is estimated as 26.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Jean-Baptiste Maunier in 2016. Born in 1990, he would be approximately 26 years old that year.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 26"
