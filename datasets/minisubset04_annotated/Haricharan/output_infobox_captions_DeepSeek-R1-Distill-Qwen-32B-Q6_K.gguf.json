        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to determine if Haricharan is present in the image described by the caption and estimate his age if possible. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the Wikipedia excerpt to get Haricharan's details. He was born on March 20, 1987, so that's his birth year. The excerpt also mentions his career, including his debut in 2004 and his rise to fame around 2010 with the song \"Thuli Thuli.\" \n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"Haricharan performing at an event.\" The caption explicitly mentions his name, which suggests that he is present in the image. According to the guidelines, if the person's name is explicitly stated, the probability should be high, between 0.9 and 1.0. \n\nNow, for the age estimation. The caption doesn't mention a specific year, so I need to infer the year from the context. Since Haricharan is a contemporary artist, the event could be recent. Let's assume the image is from 2023. Subtracting his birth year (1987) from 2023 gives an estimated age of 36. \n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should state that the caption explicitly includes Haricharan's name, confirming his presence. The age is estimated based on the assumed current year, making it 36. The probability is set to 0.98 as it's a high certainty case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Haricharan is performing at an event. He was born in 1987, and assuming the image is from 2023, he would be approximately 36 years old.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 36"
