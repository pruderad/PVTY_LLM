The Wikipedia excerpt gives a lot of details about her life and career, including her birthdate on September 23, 1999. \n\nLooking at the image caption: \"upright=1|left|Yuqi in 2018\". This caption explicitly mentions \"Yuqi\" and the year 2018. Since the name matches exactly with the subject of the Wikipedia excerpt, it's a clear indication that she is present in the image. \n\nNow, calculating her age in 2018. She was born in 1999, so subtracting 1999 from 2018 gives us 19 years old. \n\nAs for the probability of her being present, since the caption directly states her name and the year, it's a high certainty. According to the guidelines, explicit name matches should have a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. So, I'll assign a probability of 0.98.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention the explicit mention of her name and the year, along with the calculated age. The JSON structure will reflect these findings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Yuqi in 2018. She was born in 1999, making her 19 years old at the time.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 19"

        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to determine if Song Yuqi is present in the image based on the provided Wikipedia excerpt and image caption. \n\nFirst, looking at the Wikipedia excerpt, I see that Song Yuqi, also known as Yuqi, is a Chinese singer and member of the group (G)I-dle. She was born on September 23, 1999. The excerpt mentions her activities up until 2024, including her solo debut and various collaborations.\n\nNext, examining the image caption: \"upright=1|right|Yuqi in 2021\". This caption explicitly states that the image is of Yuqi from the year 2021. \n\nSince the caption directly mentions her name and the year, this is an explicit name match. According to the guidelines, explicit mentions should have a high probability, so I'll assign a probability of 0.98.\n\nNow, to estimate her age in 2021. She was born in 1999, so subtracting 1999 from 2021 gives us 22 years old.\n\nTherefore, the subject is present with a high probability, and her estimated age is 22.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Yuqi is in the image from 2021.
