Early life and junior career

He initially focused on middle-distance events and cross country. By the end of 2008 he had won the Surrey cross country title and the 3000 metres titles at the UK School Games and the English Schools Championships.

Hay made his international debut for Great Britain in the 2009 season, starting with an appearance at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in the junior race. He ran in the 1500 metres at the 2009 World Youth Championships in Athletics, being eliminated in the heats.Jonathan Hay. IAAF. Retrieved on 2014-12-16. At the end of the year he came 23rd in the junior race at the 2009 European Cross Country Championships. On the circuit he placed third in the junior 3000 m at the Aviva London Grand Prix and won the Gateshead leg of the UK Cross Challenge series. He returned to the cross country internationals the following year, improving to 62nd at the World Cross and 14th at the European Cross. That same year, he made his debut in road running at the Guernsey Easter Running Festival, winning the 10K run and coming runner-up in the half marathon.

He claimed his first senior national title at the England Cross Country Championships two weeks later. This preceded his best outing yet at the 2011 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he placed 39th in the junior section. At the national junior trials he won both the 1500 m and 5000 metres.

Under-23 competitions
He started the 2012 season with his first senior level success against international competition: he was runner-up to Asbel Kiprop at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country, defeating Olympic medallists Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele in the process.Turnbull, Simon (2012-01-09). Hay delighted with notable scalps as Kiprop starts well. The Independent. Retrieved on 2014-12-16. He started studying chemistry at the University of Birmingham and proved himself in student competition with a win at the BUCS Cross Country. He retained his English cross country title shortly after. Hay was the winner of the 1500 m at the UK under-23 Championships, but a week later he didn't make it past the heats of that event at the British Olympic Trials for the 2012 London Olympics. He took to the roads at the end of the year instead, coming third at the Great Yorkshire Run and 16th at the Great North Run.

Hay mainly competed in British Milers Club meetings in 2013, although he did manage sixth in the 5000 m at that year's British Athletics Championships as well as twelfth place and team gold in the under-23 section of the 2013 European Cross Country Championships. He struggled to transition into the senior ranks on the track the following year, coming 15th nationally in the 5000 m despite winning the British under-23 title. He placed within the top ten at the Great North Run. He returned to the European Under-23 Cross Country race and managed fourth place – Britain's best performer – and led the British to the team silver medals behind Russia.U23 Men Final - Sun, Dec 14 10:16.
