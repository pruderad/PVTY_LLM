        "generated_response": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if Hamadi Jebali is present in the image described by the caption. The Wikipedia excerpt says he was Prime Minister of Tunisia from December 2011 to March 2013. His date of birth is January 12, 1949. \n\nLooking at the image caption: \"200px|Jebali during the WEF 2012\". WEF stands for World Economic Forum, which is an annual event. The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but the event in 2012 would have been held around that time. \n\nSince the caption mentions \"Jebali during the WEF 2012\", it directly refers to him being present at that event in 2012. So, the probability that he's in the image should be high because his name is explicitly stated. \n\nNow, for his age. He was born in 1949, and the image is from 2012. So, subtracting 1949 from 2012 gives 63 years old. \n\nI think the subject_present_probability should be around 0.98 because the caption clearly states his presence. The estimated age is 63. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should reflect that he's present with a high probability and his age calculated based on the year mentioned in the caption.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Hamadi Jebali during the WEF 2012, indicating his presence. Born in 1949, he would be 63 years old in 2012.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": 63"
