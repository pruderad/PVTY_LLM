        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Hamadi Jebali is present in the image described by the caption \"Jebali in 2012.\" The Wikipedia excerpt provides his birth date, which is January 12, 1949. \n\nFirst, I'll check the image caption. It says \"Jebali in 2012.\" That's pretty explicit. The name is mentioned, and the year is given. So, it's clear that the image is of him in that specific year.\n\nNext, I need to determine the probability that he's present. Since the caption explicitly names him and the year, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category. According to the guidelines, this should be a high probability, probably around 0.95 to 1.0. But since it's not absolutely certain (though it's very close), I'll go with 0.98 as in the example.\n\nNow, estimating his age. He was born in 1949, and the image is from 2012. Subtracting 1949 from 2012 gives 63 years old. So, his age in the image would be 63.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation should mention that the caption explicitly states his presence and the year, allowing us to calculate his age accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that Hamadi Jebali is in the image from 2012.
