Controversies
Duncan was involved in some minor controversy on September 14, 2007, when, before the game between the Yankees and Red Sox at Fenway Park, Duncan wrote "Red Sox Suck!" along with his autograph on a 10-year-old Red Sox fan's notebook.

During a spring training game on March 12, 2008, against the Tampa Bay Rays, after safely reaching first due to an error, Duncan continued on to second base, spiking second baseman Akinori Iwamura who had caught the ball well before Duncan arrived. Iwamura sustained a cut above his right knee but was otherwise fine, and Duncan was tagged out regardless. This followed the Raysâ€™ Elliot Johnson's aggressive hit on Yankee catcher Francisco Cervelli, which resulted in a broken wrist for the catcher. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, after which Duncan and Rays right fielder Jonny Gomes were ejected, as were two of the Yankees' coaches, Bobby Meacham and Kevin Long. On March 14, Duncan, teammate Melky Cabrera and Gomes were suspended for their actions on the field. Each of these three players' suspensions was reduced one day in length after they decided to drop their appeal of the suspensions.

 Personal life 
Duncan is the oldest son of Dave Duncan, an MLB catcher and pitching coach. His younger brother, Chris, was also an MLB first baseman and outfielder. As of 2018, Duncan is married to his wife Kirsten Duncan. They both live in Tucson, Arizona.
