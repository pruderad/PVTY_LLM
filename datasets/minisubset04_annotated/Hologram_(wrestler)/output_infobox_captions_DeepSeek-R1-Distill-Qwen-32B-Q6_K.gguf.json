        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Hologram, who is also known as Aramís, is present in the image described by the caption. The Wikipedia excerpt gives me some details about his career, including that he signed with AEW in 2024 and started using the Hologram gimmick around that time. His real name isn't public, which is common for masked wrestlers.\n\nThe image caption is \"Hologram as Aramís in 2020.\" Hmm, so the caption mentions both names, Hologram and Aramís. From the Wikipedia, I know that Aramís is his former ring name, and he transitioned to Hologram when he joined AEW in 2024. But the image is from 2020, which is before he joined AEW. That seems a bit confusing because if he became Hologram in 2024, how could he be Hologram in 2020?\n\nWait, maybe the caption is referring to him as Aramís, using the Hologram gimmick in 2020. But according to the Wikipedia, he only started portraying Hologram in 2024. So that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the caption is incorrect or there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the image is showing him as Hologram, but that wouldn't make sense because he hadn't adopted that persona yet in 2020.\n\nAlternatively, the caption might be mistakenly using both names, thinking they're the same, but in reality, Hologram is a separate character he started in 2024. So in 2020, he was still Aramís. So if the image is from 2020 and refers to him as Hologram, that's incorrect because he hadn't taken on that identity yet. Therefore, the presence of Hologram in the image is questionable.\n\nBut wait, the caption says \"Hologram as Aramís,\" which might imply that it's showing him in his previous identity. So maybe the image is of Aramís, and the caption is using both names to refer to the same person. That could be possible. So in that case, the person in the image is Aramís, who is Hologram.\n\nBut given that he became Hologram in 2024, an image from 2020 would show him as Aramís, not Hologram. So the caption might be confusing or incorrect. Therefore, the presence of Hologram in the image is not certain. It could be a mistake, or it could be that the caption is trying to link both identities, but that's not accurate.\n\nSo, considering the guidelines, if the caption explicitly states the person's name, it's a high probability. But in this case, the caption is a bit confusing because it's using both names in a way that might not be accurate based on the timeline from Wikipedia. So I'm not entirely sure if Hologram is present in the image or if it's just Aramís.\n\nSince the caption explicitly mentions Hologram as Aramís, but based on the Wikipedia, Hologram is a later identity, I think the probability should be moderate because it's not clear if the image is correctly representing Hologram or just Aramís. So maybe a probability around 0.6.\n\nAs for the age, the Wikipedia excerpt doesn't provide a birth year. It mentions that his real name isn't public and that he's a masked wrestler. So without a birth year, I can't calculate his age. Therefore, the estimated age should be \"unknown.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption refers to Hologram as Aramís in 2020, but Hologram was introduced in 2024. This creates ambiguity about the subject's identity in the image. Without a birth year, the age cannot be determined.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.6,\n  \"estimated_age\": \"unknown\""
