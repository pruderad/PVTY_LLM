Guillaume Cailleau (born 15 February 1978 in Saumur) is a French artist, filmmaker and producer whose interest lies in exploring new forms to address political and social issues.

 Biography 
From 2006 to 2011 Guillaume Cailleau studied at the Berlin University of the Arts and was a postgraduate student under Heinz Emigholz. Before his art studies he graduated as an engineer from Icam in Nantes. He also worked as a cinema projectionist in Paris and Berlin.

In 2007 Guillaume Cailleau shot his first short film Blitzkrieg, which premiered at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Other films followed, such as Through, a reference to Michael Snow's installation Windowed Water (2007), the manually processed film H(I)J (2009), and Austerity Measures (2012), a collaboration with Ben Russell shot in Athens. In February 2014 Guillaume Cailleau was awarded a Silver Bear for his short film Laborat at the Berlinale Film Festival.
Since 2009 Guillaume Cailleau has been a member of the independent film collective LaborBerlin. As a freelance video artist, he has worked in theater productions by Thomas Ostermeier, Hakan Savaş Mican und Mala Kline. In addition Cailleau developed numerous audiovisual performances, for instance with the experimental sound artist Werner Dafeldecker and the composer and conductor Timo Kreuser which were featured at international venues such as the Edinburgh International Film Festival (2014), Scratch Expanded Paris (2013) and COLOR SOUND FRAMES (2015) at Serralves Museum.

In addition to his own artistic practice, Cailleau successfully produces films with his company CASKFILMS, collaborating with artists such as Ben Russell, Gustavo Jahn, Sasha Litvintseva & Beny Wagner and Lucile Desamory. Cailleau is co-producer of Ben Russell's Film "Good Luck" (2017), which premiered at the Locarno Festival and was shown as a 4-channel video installation at documenta 14 in Kassel.

 Style 
Guillaume Cailleau's work is influenced by American avant-garde cinema and performative practices in Expanded Cinema. Experimenting with duration, multiple exposures, color separation and manually treated single images, in addition to other methods of image editing, the forms of his films relate directly to their subjects. The process of filmmaking is often foregrounded in the artist's poetic compositions.
