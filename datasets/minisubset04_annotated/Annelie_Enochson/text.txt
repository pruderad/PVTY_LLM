Minorities in China were given much media when Enochson nominated the Uighur champion of human rights Rebeiya Kadéer for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In April 2008, Enochson hosted a visit by Kadéer that rendered much attention in the Swedish media. Enochson is also a known friend of Israel and chairwoman of the chapter of the Sweden-Israel Friendship Association in West Sweden. In May 2008 Enochson was awarded the Jerusalem-price by the World Zionist Federation for her work in support of the nation of Israel.

Enochson put forth a motion on “Abducted Children” in the Parliament in 2006. Her motion described how children in custody battles are kidnapped by their parents and brought abroad.
