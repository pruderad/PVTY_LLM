That's his date of birth. \n\nNow, the image caption is \"left|Holmgren in 1997\". So the caption explicitly mentions Holmgren and the year 1997. \n\nSince the name matches exactly, the probability that he's in the image should be high. The guidelines say explicit name matches get 0.9-1.0, so I'll go with 0.98.\n\nFor the age estimation, subtract his birth year from 1997. 1997 minus 1948 is 49. So he was 49 years old in 1997.\n\nThe explanation should state that the caption clearly shows he's in the image from 1997, and calculate his age based on his birth year.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have a high probability, the age as 49, and a clear explanation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Holmgren is in the image from 1997.

        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Michael Holmgren is present in the image described by the caption and estimate his age if possible. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the Wikipedia excerpt to get Holmgren's name and date of birth. From the excerpt, it says he was born on June 15, 1948. That's clear.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"right|Holmgren in a 1998 game.\" The caption explicitly mentions Holmgren's name and refers to a game in 1998. Since the caption directly states his presence, this is an explicit name match. According to the guidelines, this should have a high probability, likely between 0.9 and 1.0. I think 0.98 is appropriate because it's a direct mention, so it's almost certain.\n\nNow, for estimating his age. The image is from 1998, and he was born in 1948. Subtracting 1948 from 1998 gives us 50 years old. So, his estimated age would be 50.\n\nI don't see any issues here. The caption clearly includes his name and the year, so the age calculation is straightforward. There's no ambiguity, so the probability is high, and the age is known.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Holmgren in a 1998 game.
