Parliamentary career

 1st term (2017–2019) 
Peacock was elected to Parliament as MP for Barnsley East at the snap 2017 general election with 59.5% of the vote and a majority of 13,283.

Her maiden speech occurred during a Grenfell Tower debate during which she mentioned the local issue of Orgreave.

From January 2018 until March 2019 she served as an Opposition Whip. She resigned on 14 March 2019 after defying the whip to vote against an amendment calling for a second Brexit referendum.

In November 2018, Peacock, alongside fellow Women's Parliamentary Football teammates, Alison McGovern, Tracey Crouch, Louise Haigh and Hannah Bardell, was rebuked by the then Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, for having a 'kickabout' in the House of Commons after Parliamentary business. Bercow said that the "historic chamber should not be used for this type of activity". The team had been due to play their first match, but the game was cancelled because they had to be in parliament for a vote.

 2nd term (2019–2024) 
At the 2019 general election, Peacock was re-elected as MP for Barnsley East with a decreased vote share of 37.6% and a decreased majority of 3,217.

In January 2020 Peacock joined Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office team as the Shadow Minister responsible for the Veterans' Office and Procurement. Following the election of Keir Starmer as the Leader of the Labour Party (UK), she was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Fisheries, Water and Flooding as part of Labour's Shadow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs team.

Peacock endorsed Lisa Nandy in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election.

In February 2020, Peacock campaigned to change the maximum sentences for causing death by dangerous driving from fourteen years to life, as well as reforming the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme to get more money for retired miners.

On 14 May 2021, Peacock was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Veterans following a reshuffle.

 3rd term (2024–) 
Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Peacock's constituency of Barnsley East was abolished, and replaced with Barnsley South. At the 2024 general election, Peacock was elected to Parliament as MP for Barnsley South with 46.7% of the vote and a majority of 4,748.
