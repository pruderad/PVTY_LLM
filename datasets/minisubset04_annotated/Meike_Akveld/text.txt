Meike Maria Elisabeth Akveld is a Swiss mathematician and textbook author, whose professional interests include knot theory, symplectic geometry, and mathematics education. She is a tenured senior scientist and lecturer in the mathematics and teacher education group in the Department of Mathematics at ETH Zurich. She is also the organizer of the Mathematical Kangaroo competitions in Switzerland, and president of the Association Kangourou sans Frontières, a French-based international society devoted to the popularization of mathematics.

Education
Akveld earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Warwick and took Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge. She completed her Ph.D. at ETH Zurich in 2000, with the dissertation Hofer geometry for Lagrangian loops, a Legendrian knot and a travelling wave jointly supervised by Dietmar Salamon and Leonid Polterovich.
