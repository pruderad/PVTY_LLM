        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to figure out whether Benjamin Leroy is present in the image described by the caption. Let's start by looking at the Wikipedia excerpt. It says he was born on 7 April 1989 and is a French footballer. His career includes playing for several clubs, including Ajaccio from 19 June 2018 onwards.\n\nThe image caption is \"Leroy with [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]] in 2018.\" The caption explicitly mentions Leroy and his association with Ajaccio in the year 2018. Since the caption directly names him and the year, it's a clear indication that he is present in the image.\n\nNow, for the estimated age. He was born in 1989, and the image is from 2018. Subtracting 1989 from 2018 gives us 29 years old. So, his age at the time of the image would be 29.\n\nRegarding the probability of his presence, since the caption explicitly states his name and the context, the probability should be high. According to the guidelines, an explicit name match should have a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. I think 0.98 is appropriate here because it's a direct mention without any ambiguity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the explanation would be that the caption clearly states Leroy is with Ajaccio in 2018, making his presence certain. His age is calculated as 29. The probability is set to 0.98 due to the explicit mention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Benjamin Leroy is with Ajaccio in 2018.
