He worked as Chief Financial Officer of the Organization of American States in Guatemala and advisor to the offices of the Organization of American States of Ecuador and Honduras. Brolo was appointed as Delegate for the Truth Commission in Honduras, and has worked in the Congress of the Republic as a political analyst.

Brolo was proclaimed candidate for mayor by the Vamos in March 2019, being defeated by Mayor Ricardo Quiñónez Lemus of the Unionist Party in 16 June 2019. Brolo was defeated and obtained fifth place with more than 9,000 votes and 2.2% of the votes.

President-elect Alejandro Giammattei appointed Brolo as Minister of Foreign Affairs and declared that «Brolo will be the youngest Foreign Minister in the history of Guatemala.» However, that comment is incorrect, since there were several younger ones including Guillermo Toriello Garrido, Jorge Skinner-Klée, and Luis Molina Bedoya.
