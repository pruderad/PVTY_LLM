Sheila Jordan (born Sheila Jeanette Dawson; November 18, 1928) is an American jazz singer and songwriter. She has recorded as a session musician with an array of critically acclaimed artists in addition to recording her own albums. Jordan pioneered a bebop and scat jazz singing style with an upright bass as the only accompaniment. Jordan's music has earned praise from many critics, particularly for her ability to improvise lyrics; Scott Yanow describes her as "one of the most consistently creative of all jazz singers." Charlie Parker often introduced Jordan as "the lady with the million dollar ears.""Saturday, March 21st: 10:30 – Focus on Women in Music". KPFA Folio. March 1981. p. 26.

Biography
Early career
Sheila Jordan was born in Detroit, Michigan. Her childhood was very difficult. Her mother was only 17 when Sheila was born and struggled to raise a child, unfortunately turning to alcohol as a means of coping. Jordan was sent to live with her grandparents in the small coal mining town of Summerhill, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny Mountains. She grew up with nine siblings who were really her aunts and uncles. Life with her grandparents was difficult -- money was tight, there was little warmth or affection from her grandparents, and her grandfather was also an alcoholic. Jordan has said: "We were probably the poorest people in a poor town…we had an outhouse and no water in the house… In the wintertime all of us would sleep in one bedroom without any sheets or pillowcases on the beds; we just had blankets.”

She returned to Detroit, living with her mother, in 1940 or 1942. She sang and played piano in jazz clubs in Detroit. She was a member of the trio Skeeter, Mitch, and Jean (Skeeter Spight, Leroi Mitchell, and Jordan, using part of her middle name, was "Jean"), which wrote lyrics to music by Charlie Parker. They went to Parker's performances in Detroit, met him, and he would ask them to sing.

In 1951, Jordan moved to New York City and studied harmony and music theory with Lennie Tristano and Charles Mingus, but concentrated onthe music of Charlie Parker. Jordan and Parker became friends before his death in 1955; she refers to him as one of her teachers. From 1952–1962, she was married to Duke Jordan, who played piano in Parker's band.  Although the marriage was unhappy (Duke Jordan was addicted to heroin),it produced a daughter, Tracy, of whom Sheila says she finally had someone “that I could truly love and that I was sure would love me back”.

In a 2012 interview with JazzWax, when asked why she moved to New York, Jordan said, "I guess I was chasin' the Bird [Parker]." When asked if the song "Chasin' the Bird" was written for her, she replied, "No. I don't know how that rumor got started."

1960s
In the early 1960s, Jordan performed at the Page Three Club in Greenwich Village with pianist Herbie Nichols, and at other bars and clubs inNew York City. She withdrew from clubs for much of the '60s to raise her daughter, and sang in church instead. For 20 years, she worked as a typist and legal secretary with little time to concentrate on music until she was 58.

In 1962, she worked with George Russell, with whom she recorded the song, "You Are My Sunshine" on his album The Outer View (Riverside). Later that year she recorded the album Portrait of Sheila released by Blue Note. Her long working relationship with Steve Kuhn began in the early 1960s. She also played with Don Heckman (1967–68), Lee Konitz (1972), and Roswell Rudd (1972–75).

In 1974, Jordan was Artist in Residence at City College of New York and taught there from 1978–2005. In 2006, she was presented the Manhattan Association of Cabarets & Clubs (MAC) Lifetime Achievement Award and celebrated 28 years as an adjunct professor of music. She has taught at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Vermont Jazz Center, Interplay Jazz and Arts, as well as teaching international workshops.

On July 12, 1975, she recorded Confirmation. One year later she released the duet album Sheila, with Arild Andersen for SteepleChase. In 1979, she founded a quartet with Steve Kuhn, Harvie S, and Bob Moses. During the 1980s, she worked with Harvie S as a duo and played on several records with him. Until 1987 she worked in an advertising agency and recorded Lost and Found in 1989.

Jordan is a songwriter who works in bebop and free jazz. In addition to the aforementioned musicians, she has recorded with the George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band, Cameron Brown, Carla Bley, and Steve Swallow. In the UK she appeared with former John Dankworth Band vocalist Frank Holder. She has led recordings for Blue Note, Blackhawk, East Wind, ECM, Grapevine, Muse, Palo Alto, and SteepleChase
