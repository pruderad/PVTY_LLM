S. P. Varma is a social worker and peace activist from Jammu and Kashmir. He has been actively involved in peace-building efforts in conflict-ridden areas of the Kashmir valley.

 Early life and career 
In 1990, he met Nirmala Deshpande, a prominent Gandhian figure, in Jammu, which influenced his decision to leave his government job as a Civil Engineer and embrace Gandhism.

Varma organized local communities to facilitate inter-faith meetings with the aim of rebuilding trust in the troubled Kashmir valley. He expanded this movement to other disturbed regions such as Doda, Udhampur, Rajouri, and Poonch. This success motivated him to gradually extend his efforts to other parts of India, particularly in North East India and areas affected by Naxalite insurgency.

Between 1990 and 2015, S. P. Varma coordinated National Integration Camps, Aman Melas, Peace Marches, All-faith prayers, Seminars, Conferences, Workshops, Gandhian quiz competitions, and cultural-sports events in collaboration with various agencies.

He also collaborated with Sunil Dutt, a Union Minister and noted Bollywood actor, to lead the work of Sadbhawana ke Sipahi in Jammu and Kashmir as the chairman of the local chapter.

In 2012, the Government of India recognized his contributions with the Padma Shri award. In 2017, De Montfort University, England, conferred an Honorary Doctorate (D Lit) on him for his peace work in India.

Since 2016, he has served as the NGO delegate for the Gandhi Global Family to the UN Department of Global Communication (DGC), New York.

 Voluntary Services and Awareness Programs 

One of Varma's notable achievements is the organization of symposiums on truth and non-violence. These symposiums took place in schools, colleges, and universities across Jammu and Kashmir States from 1990 to 2015. What began as a local endeavor evolved into a national movement in 2010, thanks to support from the Union Ministry of HRD.

In April 1997, Varma organized the All India Gandhian Workers National Samelan, a significant event held at M.A. Stadium, Jammu. This gathering attracted over 25,000 Gandhian Workers from across the country. The summit featured a notable address by the then Prime Minister, Shri I.K. Gujral.

Varma provided these invaluable texts to over 100,000 individuals in Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, Varma supplied complete sets of Mahatma Gandhi's autobiographies in different languages to numerous high-ranking dignitaries and grassroots workers.

On 20 January 2003, Varma orchestrated the Jammu and Kashmir State Sadbhavana – Ke – Sipahi convention. This event drew thousands of SKS volunteers from across the state. Distinguished figures like Hon’ble Congress President Smt. Sonia Gandhi, Jammu and Kashmir PCC President Jenab Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji graced the occasion. Smt. Sonia Gandhi used this platform to present the "Rajiv Gandhi State Sadbhavana Awards" to commend outstanding individuals and organizations for their work in promoting peace and harmony, regardless of political affiliations.

Under Varma's leadership, the "Bharat Jodo Abhiyan" was launched in Srinagar. This initiative saw thousands of Sadbhavana Ke Sipahi from the State come together to commemorate the sacrifices of Mahatma Gandhi, Smt. Indira Gandhi, and Sh. Rajiv Gandhi. Participants pledged to work tirelessly for the unity and integrity of the nation. Their dedication earned them recognition from Jenab Ghulam Nabi Azad, President PCC Jammu and Kashmir.

Varma had organised a variety of social awareness programs. These initiatives tackle critical issues such as Anti-Dowry systems, Save the Girl Child, Drug Abuse, Gender Equality, and Ecology Literacy.

S. P. Varma played a significant role in identifying and engaging with Veteran Gandhians and Freedom Fighters, publicly acknowledging their contributions, and harnessing their experiences to instill a sense of national pride among the younger generation.

S. P. Varma has been actively involved in commemorating the birth and death anniversaries of 80 prominent freedom fighters from across the nation at various locations throughout the country.

Furthermore, S. P. Varma has played a role in fostering communal harmony by organizing joint celebrations of various national festivals, including Independence Day, Republic Day, Gandhi Jayanti, Diwali, EID, Gurupurab, Christmas, Buddha Jayanti, and Mahavir Janma Kalyanak. These celebrations involve active participation from people of all faiths, promoting unity and inclusivity.

In 2002, S. P. Varma organized the Sadbhavana Padyatra, led by Sh. Sunil Dutt, from the Golden Temple in Amritsar to the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, passing through the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine.

Between 1990 and 2010, S. P. Varma actively participated in Padyatras alongside notable figures such as Didi Nirmala Deshpande, Sh. Sunil Dutt, and Sh. Sunder Lal Bahuguna. These Padyatras aimed to promote peace, harmony, and the protection of the environment, taking place in various parts of the country.

S. P. Varma also organized exposure trips for Gandhian Workers from Jammu and Kashmir to other regions of India starting in 1992, allowing them to participate in Annual Conventions.
