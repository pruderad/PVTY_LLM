Huang Xiyang (, born June 14, 1985) is a Chinese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for China League One club Chongqing Tonglianglong.

Club career
Huang was the product of the Chongqing Lifan youth team and would start his professional football career with Chongqing Lifan in the 2005 league season, where he quickly established himself as a regular. This was soon followed by his first professional goal on 18 May 2005 when he scored his against Sichuan Guancheng in the first round of the Super League Cup in a 5-1 victory. After six seasons with Chongqing Lifan, Huang was a loyal member of the team as they experienced relegation and promotion back into the Chinese Super League until on December 8, 2010, he decided to transfer to top-tier club Henan Construction.

At Henan, Huang immediately established himself as a regular within the team, however, he would once again experience relegation at the end of the 2012 league season. After only one season he would help guide Henan to the division title and immediate promotion back into the Chinese Super League. In the following season Henan would be in a fight to avoid relegation, however despite being a vital member of the team, Huang was suspended from the team and returned to his hometown of Chongqing after disagreeing with the Head coach Jia Xiuquan's tactics and his contract renewal. On 25 December 2014, Huang transferred to Chinese Super League side Hangzhou Greentown. He transferred to China League One side Wuhan Zall on 14 January 2017.

He made his return to Chongqing Dangdai on 24 June, 2020.
