        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. I have to determine if the person described in the Wikipedia excerpt is present in the image based on the given caption. Additionally, I should estimate their age if possible.\n\nLooking at the Wikipedia excerpt, the person is Henry Bertrand Marie Armand de Lesquen du Plessis-Casso, born on January 1, 1949. He's a French politician with a long career, including founding the Carrefour de l'Horloge and running for president in 2017. \n\nNow, the image caption is \"De Lesquen in 2017.\" This explicitly mentions his name and the year. Since the caption directly refers to him, it's a clear indication that he is present in the image. \n\nNext, estimating his age. He was born in 1949, and the image is from 2017. Subtracting 1949 from 2017 gives 68 years old. \n\nFor the probability, since the caption explicitly states his presence, I should assign a high probability. According to the guidelines, explicit name matches fall into the 0.9-1.0 range. Given that the year is also provided, this further supports the presence, so a probability of 0.98 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation would mention the explicit name match and the calculation of his age based on the birth year and the year in the caption. The probability is high, and the age is accurately calculated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that De Lesquen is in the image from 2017.
