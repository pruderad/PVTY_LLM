Elena Kaliská (born 19 January 1972) is a retired Slovak slalom canoeist who competed at the international level from 1988 to 2019. She specialized in the K1 event, which was the only discipline available for women during the vast majority of her career.

Competing in four Summer Olympics, she won two gold medals in the K1 event, earning them in 2004 and 2008.

Kaliská also won five medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships with two golds (K1: 2005, K1 team: 2011), two silvers (K1: 2007, K1 team: 2009) and a bronze (K1 team: 2014).

She has won the overall World Cup title 6 times (2000-2001, 2003–2006), which is a record the K1 discipline.

At the European Championships she won a total of 16 medals (8 golds, 4 silvers and 4 bronzes).

In 2021, she won a gold medal in K1 at inaugural ICF Masters Canoe Slalom World Championship in Kraków.

She announced her retirement from the sport during the 2021 World Championships in Bratislava, where she performed demo runs. Kaliská began competing in canoe slalom as soon as 1979.

Career

Kaliská represented Czechoslovakia at two World Junior Championships, winning a silver medal in the K1 team event in 1990 and finishing 4th in the K1 event.

She made her World Championship debut in 1993 in Mezzana where she finished 9th in the K1 event. Her first medal came at the World Cup in Prague in 1996, where she took bronze. She followed it up with another bronze one week later at the inaugural European Championships in Augsburg.

She recorded her first World Cup win in 1998 on her home course in Liptovský Mikuláš and followed it up by winning her first European title in Roudnice nad Labem.

In 2000 she won the overall World Cup title in K1 for the first time in her career. She defended the title in 2001 and then went on to win four consecutive titles from 2003 to 2006. Her dominance was most pronounced in 2004, when she won 4 out of 6 World Cup races (having only started in 5 races).

Despite her success in the World Cup, she had to wait until 2004 to claim her first major global medal. She finally broke through by winning the Olympic gold at the Athens games. One year later she claimed her only individual world title in Penrith.

In order to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics, she had to defeat the 2006 World Champion Jana Dukátová in the internal qualification. She managed to secure her spot by taking silver medal at the 2007 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships. She won the 2008 Olympic gold in a dominant fashion, winning the heats, semifinal run and the final run. In a race where many of the big favorites struggled she was able to stay clean and win by a margin of 14.30 seconds.

Kaliská had a long career spanning several decades, similar to her great rival Štěpánka Hilgertová in longevity and success. She had her final international race in 2019 and officially retired in 2021.

She won all the major accolades that the sport of canoe slalom has to offer - Olympic gold, World Championship gold, World Cup and European Championships.
