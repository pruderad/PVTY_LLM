        "generated_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Gerald Wayne \"Ged\" Wright is present in the image described by the caption. The caption is \"Brigadier General Gerald W. Wright.\" Hmm, that's pretty straightforward. The name matches exactly with the person from the Wikipedia excerpt. So, I think the probability that he's present is high.\n\nNow, for the age estimation. The Wikipedia excerpt says he was born on July 7, 1942. The image caption doesn't mention a specific year, but it refers to him as a Brigadier General. I wonder if I can infer a year from his military career. Looking back, he retired in March 1999. If the image is from around that time, he would be 57 years old (1999 - 1942 = 57). But the caption doesn't specify when the image was taken. It could be any time during his career.\n\nWait, the image caption just mentions his rank and name, without any date. So, without a specific year, I can't accurately calculate his age. Therefore, the estimated age should be \"unknown.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the subject is definitely present because the caption explicitly names him. The probability is high, around 0.98. Since there's no year, the age is unknown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Brigadier General Gerald W. Wright is in the image. His birth year is 1942, but no specific year is provided in the caption to calculate his age.\",\n    \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n    \"estimated_age\": \"unknown\""
