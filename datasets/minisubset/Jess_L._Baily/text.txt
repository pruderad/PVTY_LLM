Eventually Baily would be appointed as the United States' Ambassador to Macedonia on December 23, 2014, a position he would hold until March 1, 2019. In 2017 he would add his voice to other critics of, then president, Gjorge Ivanov for withholding a mandate from opposition leader, Zoran Zaev, over the inclusion of ethnic Albanians in his proposed coalition. That same year he, alongside the USAID, would come under scrutiny by Judicial Watch for funding the Open Society Foundation in what was described as potential interference in domestic political affairs.
