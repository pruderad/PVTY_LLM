        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a Wikipedia excerpt about Igor Kolyvanov and an image caption. My task is to determine if Kolyvanov is present in the image, estimate his age if possible, and provide a probability score based on the guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt to extract the essential information. Kolyvanov was born on March 6, 1968. He's a Russian football manager and former player. His coaching career includes managing teams like the Russia U17, U19, and U21 teams, as well as clubs like Torpedo Moscow. The excerpt mentions that he was the head coach of Torpedo Moscow until the end of the 2018-19 season when they were relegated, and he was replaced by Sergei Ignashevich in June 2019.\n\nNow, looking at the image caption: \"Kolyvanov coaching Torpedo Moscow in 2017.\" The caption explicitly states that Kolyvanov is coaching Torpedo Moscow in 2017. Since the Wikipedia excerpt confirms that he was indeed the head coach of Torpedo Moscow around that time (as he was replaced in 2019), this is a direct match.\n\nNext, I need to estimate his age. His birth year is 1968, and the image is from 2017. Subtracting 1968 from 2017 gives 49 years old. So, his estimated age in 2017 would be 49.\n\nFor the probability score, since the caption explicitly mentions Kolyvanov coaching Torpedo Moscow in 2017, this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category, which suggests a high probability. The guidelines mention a range of 0.9 to 1.0 for such cases. Given that the information is clear and directly matches, a score of 0.98 seems appropriate.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors that might affect the probability. The caption doesn't mention any other people or contexts that might imply uncertainty, so it's safe to stick with a high probability.\n\nIn summary, the image caption clearly states Kolyvanov's presence, and his age can be accurately calculated. Therefore, the probability is high, and the age is known.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Kolyvanov is coaching Torpedo Moscow in 2017.
