Professional career
Atlanta Braves
Shewmake was considered one of the top prospects for the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. He was selected by the Atlanta Braves with the 21st overall pick. He signed for $3.13 million, and was assigned to the Rome Braves of the Single-A South Atlantic League. After slashing .318/.389/.473 with three home runs, 39 RBIs, and 11 stolen bases over 51 games with Rome, he was promoted to the Mississippi Braves of the Double-A Southern League in August, and finished the season there. Over 14 games with Mississippi, Shewmake hit .217.

Shewmake did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021 season, he returned to Mississippi (now members of the Double-A South), slashing .228/.271/.401 with 12 home runs and forty RBIs over 83 games. Shewmake was assigned to the Gwinnett Stripers of the Triple-A International League to begin the 2022 season. In early August, he was placed on the injured list with a left leg injury after being carted off of the field following a collision with left fielder Travis Demeritte, and he missed the remainder of the season. Over 76 games prior to the injury, he slashed .259/.316/.399 with seven home runs and 25 RBIs.

On November 15, 2022, the Braves selected Shewmake's contract and added him to the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Shewmake battled with Orlando Arcia and Vaughn Grissom for the starting shortstop job during spring training in 2023. On March 20, Shewmake and Grissom were optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett in favor of Arcia.

On May 5, 2023, Shewmake was promoted to the major leagues for the first time, and made his debut later that day against the Baltimore Orioles.
