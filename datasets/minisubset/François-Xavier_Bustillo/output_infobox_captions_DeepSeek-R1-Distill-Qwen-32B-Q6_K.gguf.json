        "generated_response": "Alright, I need to determine if François-Xavier Bustillo is present in the image described by the caption \"Bustillo in 2021\" and estimate his age if possible. \n\nFirst, looking at the Wikipedia excerpt, his full name is François-Xavier Bustillo OFMConv, born on 23 November 1968. He became the Bishop of Ajaccio in 2021 and was made a cardinal in 2023.\n\nThe image caption directly mentions \"Bustillo in 2021.\" Since the caption explicitly names him, it's highly likely he's in the image. There's no mention of portraits or statues, so it's a direct reference to him being present. \n\nNext, estimating his age. The caption specifies the year 2021. Subtracting his birth year (1968) from 2021 gives 53 years old. \n\nFor the probability, since the name is explicitly stated and it's a straightforward mention without any ambiguity, I'll assign a high probability, around 0.98.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states that François-Xavier Bustillo is in the image from 2021.
