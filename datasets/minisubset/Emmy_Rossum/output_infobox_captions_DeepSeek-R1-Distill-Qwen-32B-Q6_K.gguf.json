        "generated_response": "Okay, I need to determine whether Emmanuelle Grey Rossum is present in the image described by the caption \"Rossum in 2010.\" Also, I have to estimate her age if possible.\n\nFirst, looking at the Wikipedia excerpt, her full name is Emmanuelle Grey Rossum, born on September 12, 1986. So, she was born in 1986.\n\nThe image caption is \"Rossum in 2010.\" The name \"Rossum\" is explicitly mentioned, and the year is 2010. Since the caption directly states her name and the year, it's a clear indication that she is present in the image. There's no mention of a portrait or statue, so it's likely a photograph of her.\n\nNow, calculating her age in 2010. She was born in 1986, so subtracting that from 2010 gives 24 years old. So, her estimated age would be 24.\n\nFor the probability, since the caption explicitly mentions her name and the year, it's a high probability. According to the guidelines, explicit name matches should have a probability between 0.9 and 1.0. I'll go with 0.98 to reflect a very high certainty.\n\nPutting it all together, the explanation is straightforward: the caption clearly states her presence and the year, allowing for an accurate age calculation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly states Rossum is in the image from 2010.
