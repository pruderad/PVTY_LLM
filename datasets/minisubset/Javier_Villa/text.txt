Career

García was born in Colunga, Asturias. Before driving in the GP2 Series in 2006, he raced in the Spanish F3 Championship, where he finished 4th overall in the 2005 season, with the Racing Engineering team.

Graduating to GP2 with Racing Engineering the next year, his first season was pointless, but 2007 was a significant improvement. He took his first GP2 victory in 2007 at the sprint race at Magny-Cours. He started from second on the grid by dint of finishing seventh in the previous day's feature race. He then won the sprint races at the Nürburgring and Hungaroring from pole position. He stayed with Racing Engineering for a third season of GP2 in 2008. This season was disappointing as he slipped back to seventeenth in the championship, whereas team-mate Giorgio Pantano won it.

Villa drove for Super Nova Racing in the 2008–09 GP2 Asia Series season, and also drove for the team in the 2009 GP2 Series season. He was linked with a race seat at Formula One team Campos Grand Prix for 2010 but when they turned into Hispania Racing Team he wasn't linked anymore.

The 2010 season he forged links with BMW driving in the Spanish Mini Challenge Championship. He won that title and was rewarded with a drive in the final round of the 2010 Australian Mini Challenge in Sydney finishing seventh. 2011 Australian Mini Challenge Rd 7, retrieved Mini Challenge Official site 17/4/2011

In 2011, Villa would move to the World Touring Car Championship with Proteam Motorsport BMW team, where he scored his first podium in Hungary. He had a disappointing end to the season falling out of the top ten finishing 12th for the season. He was voted best rookie in the World Touring Car Championship for the 2011 season.

He was linked with the Formula One team Hispania Racing with a view to replace Vitantonio Liuzzi. He again competed in the Spanish Mini Challenge in 2011 and despite missing three races, still finished in fifth position for the championship.

Villa moved for 2012 to the Racecar Euro Series, a NASCAR-sanctioned stock car championship, where he finished third in the championship with a win and six podium finishes.
