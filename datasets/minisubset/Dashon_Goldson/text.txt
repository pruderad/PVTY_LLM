He played college football for the Washington Huskies, and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL draft. He also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Washington Redskins, and Atlanta Falcons.

Early life

He played high school football at Narbonne High School in Harbor City, CA where as a senior he totaled 130 tackles and six interceptions, with two returned for touchdowns.

College career

Professional career

San Francisco 49ers
2009 season
Goldson was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round (126th overall) in the 2007 NFL draft. In his rookie season, he played in ten games, recording 15 tackles as a backup to then-starting safety Mark Roman. In his second year with the 49ers, Goldson recorded 21 tackles as a backup.

In 2009, the 49ers front office announced that Goldson would be the starter for free safety going into next season, while giving current starter Mark Roman permission to seek a trade. Although at the time this move was highly questioned, Goldson quickly proved doubters wrong.

Goldson made his NFL debut as a starter against the divisional rival Arizona Cardinals on September 13, where the 49ers were victorious on the season opener, winning 20–16 against the reigning NFC conference champions. In Week 2, Goldson recorded his first career interception by diving under a pass that was tipped by Nate Burleson. The 2009 season would prove to be a productive season, where Goldson led all San Francisco defenders in interceptions with four, and he also forced three fumbles. Goldson finished his first year as an NFL starter with 94 tackles, two sacks, six pass defenses and four interceptions. This was the beginning of Goldson's arrival in the league.

2010 season

Goldson struggled during much of the 2010 season, missing tackles and not forcing turnovers like he did in 2009, finishing with 59 tackles and one interception. Although the San Francisco 49ers team as a whole struggled this year, they showed strides leading up to the 2011 campaign.

2011 season
Prior to the 2011 season, Goldson was an unrestricted free agent and visited with the New England Patriots. He ultimately decided to sign a one-year contract and re-sign with the 49ers. He was named to his first career Pro Bowl, coming in second in the NFC in voting behind Earl Thomas. He had a career-high 6 interceptions and 9 pass deflections during the regular season and is now known to be one of the hardest hitting safeties in the NFL. In the playoffs, he intercepted a Drew Brees pass and returned it near the goal line which resulted in an Alex Smith touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree to give the 49ers a first-quarter 14–0 lead.

2012 season
On October 26, 2012, Goldson was fined $7,875 for taunting the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7. On December 20, 2012, he was fined $77,500 for uniform violations and a helmet-to-helmet collision with Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez.

In the 2012 season, Goldson and the 49ers appeared in Super Bowl XLVII. In the game, he had nine combined tackles as the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 31–34.

He was named to the Pro Bowl and was named to the All-Pro team for the first time in his career.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers
On March 13, 2013, Goldson signed a five-year, $41.25 million contract, including $22 million guaranteed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He joined newly arrived cornerback Darrelle Revis and 43rd overall draft pick Johnthan Banks. On September 16, 2013, Goldson was suspended for one game for his helmet-to-helmet hit on New Orleans Saints running back Darren Sproles the previous day. Upon appeal, however, the suspension was overturned and Goldson's penalty for the hit reduced to a $100,000 fine.

In 2014, Goldson recorded 81 combined tackles, of which 63 were solo.

Washington Redskins
On April 3, 2015, Goldson was traded to the Washington Redskins, along with a seventh round pick, for a sixth round pick in the 2016 NFL draft. At the start of the 2015 season, he was voted as the team's defensive captain.

Goldson was released on March 7, 2016 after just one season with the team.

Atlanta Falcons
On August 28, 2016, Goldson was signed by the Atlanta Falcons to fill a backup role due to safety Keanu Neal injuring his knee. In four games, Goldson made one tackle, coming in a 24–26 loss to  the Seattle Seahawks in Week 6. On October 19, 2016, he was released by the Falcons. On December 20, 2016, he was re-signed by the Falcons. Goldson was inactive for the Falcons' 28–34 overtime loss to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.
