Ajara Nchout Njoya (born 12 January 1993) is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Saudi Women's Premier League club Al Qadsiah and the Cameroon women's national team.

Early life
Born in Njissé, Foumban, Nchout states that her family discouraged her from playing football, preferring that she instead focus on education.

 Club career 
In January 2015 Nchout agreed to join Western New York Flash of the NWSL. She had previously played in the Russian Top Division for FC Energy Voronezh and WFC Rossiyanka.

She was waived by the Flash in October 2015. In December 2015 she announced that she had signed for Sundsvalls DFF of the Swedish Elitettan.

Nchout later signed with Vålerenga after appearing in 22 matches for Sandviken. She missed the final of the Norwegian cup with Sandviken as she was on international duty with Cameroon, a match they lost.

 International career 
As a member of the Cameroonian national team, she played at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was also part of the national team at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.  She was capped for all four matches in the 2015 World Cup, and scored a goal against Japan, the team that ended up placing second in the tournament.  During the 2019 World Cup, she scored the team's only two goals in the team's only win of group play that led them to the round of 16. In August 2019, she was nominated for 2019 FIFA Puskas Award for her goal against New Zealand at the FIFA Women's World Cup.
