In October 2014, Staikouras presented the draft budget before the Hellenic Parliament, predicting a 2.4% rise in growth in 2015. He said: "The conditions for sustained long-term growth are in the process of being created," although doubt was cast on his predictions as they may have been "too optimistic." He served as Alternate Minister for Finance until the January 2015 legislative election, which resulted in a loss for New Democracy.

From February 2015 until July 2019, Staikouras was Coordinator of Economic Affairs for New Democracy during the party's spell in opposition, serving successively in the shadow cabinets of Antonis Samaras, Evangelos Meimarakis, Ioannis Plakiotakis and Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
