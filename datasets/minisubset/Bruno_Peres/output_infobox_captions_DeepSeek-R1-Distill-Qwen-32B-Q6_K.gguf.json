        "generated_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a Wikipedia excerpt about Bruno Peres and an image caption. My task is to determine if Bruno is present in the image, estimate his age if possible, and provide a structured JSON response.\n\nFirst, I'll read the Wikipedia excerpt to extract Bruno's name and date of birth. The excerpt starts with \"Bruno da Silva Peres (born 1 March 1990)\", so his date of birth is March 1, 1990.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the image caption: \"Bruno Peres playing for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in 2017\". The caption explicitly mentions Bruno Peres, indicating he is present in the image. The year 2017 is also mentioned, which will help in estimating his age.\n\nTo calculate his age in 2017, I'll subtract his birth year from 2017. 2017 minus 1990 equals 27 years old. However, since his birthday is on March 1, I should check if the image was taken before or after his birthday in 2017. The caption doesn't specify the exact date, so I'll assume it's around the middle of the year, making him 27 years old.\n\nNow, determining the probability of Bruno being present. The caption explicitly states his name and team, so this falls under the \"Explicit Name Match\" category. According to the guidelines, this should be a high probability, around 0.95 to 1.0. Since it's a direct mention, I'll assign a probability of 0.98, similar to the first example provided.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the explanation, probability, and age.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The caption explicitly mentions Bruno Peres playing for Roma in 2017. He was born in 1990, making him 27 years old that year.\",\n  \"subject_present_probability\": 0.98,\n  \"estimated_age\": 27"
